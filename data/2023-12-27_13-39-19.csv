Beware of Scams: Tips for safely investing in the digital world

",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/beware-of-scams-tips-for-safely-investing-in-the-digital-world-11703641777492.html,LiveMint,07:27 AM IST,"      Today’s digital world is the most egalitarian and the most vulnerable space in the world. One may grow and may perish also. This is truer when it comes to the financial world.    Digital work has made the financial markets more accessible even to investors who were not inclined to invest in the markets. The digital world is cost-efficient.    This provides a strong and convincing argument to invest in the markets. But what looks simple is too simplistic. Some people indulge in fraudulent practices and ensnare inexperienced investors.   Hence, it is important to understand the challenges involved in investing in the markets through the various avenues available. Dummy portals and appsNowadays most investors start their journey in the digital world. Even the opening of an account and Know-Your-Client (KYC) compliance are carried out online.     In most cases individuals get the link or name of the ‘mobile application’ or the portal URL from an acquaintance or through social media.     This is an important step where investors have to be extra careful. They should check if they are downloading the right app or visiting the official website of a service provider.     Sometimes online scamsters build a web portal or mobile application that resembles the official one.     Transacting on such portals or apps can lead to the compromising of the vital data of an investor. An investor may lose money also.    A prudent approach will be to identify the official website and type the website link (URL-uniform resource locator) in the web browser.     Scamsters, many times, send out a link that leads to a portal which has a domain that looks the same but has jumbled a letter or two which takes it to a fake website.     For example, instead of www.avoidfraudsters.com, one may end up clicking avoidfraudstars.com and reach a different website.    While looking for a mobile application, it makes sense to download the same from the Google Play Store or the App Store.     Never use a link received from an unknown source to download a software or mobile application.     Sometimes fraudsters create look-alike apps as well. Using such apps means allowing scamsters access to money.    In the case an investor gets a message which states that a broker has asked for a KYC update or launch of a new mobile application, then before acting on such moves, do call up the official contact centre and confirm the same.

Investors need to check if there is a connection between a successful trader whose name is being used and the services on offer.     Also, check if a person has the necessary license to carry out advisory services.     Only, SEBI-registered entities can offer services such as money management, advisory or financial services distribution.     There must be a written contract between an investor and the service provider for such services.

However, the timing and the extent of rate cuts will be the key factors. Furthermore, how central banks evaluate inflation and growth will significantly impact market sentiment.  2. General Elections 2024India will most likely see General Elections in April-May. A stable government post-election is anticipated and would be favourably received by the domestic market. While an NDA victory might not result in a substantial market upsurge, its defeat could prompt a swift, short-term reaction. Nevertheless, the market is expected to eventually refocus on fundamental aspects and corporate earnings.    ""With recent big wins in MP, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan state elections, the likelihood of NDA coming to power again in 2024 has increased substantially. We don’t think the 2024 win will trigger any sharp rally in the market, it will just be business as usual. A loss though can cause an immediate negative reaction in the markets,"" said Ashutosh Tiwari, Managing Director and Head of Institutional Equities at Equirus.    ""Foundations laid by the current government in infrastructure, manufacturing, import substitution, etc., are going to fuel economic growth over the medium term and hence barring short-term reactions, we don’t see any risk of a steep correction in the markets,"" said Tiwari.  (Exciting news! Mint is now on WhatsApp Channels. Subscribe today and stay updated with the latest financial insights! Click here!)  3. Budget 2024The Budget in February will be a Vote on Account ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. However, after the government is formed, the July Budget will be a key macro event for the market.    ""We expect the Budget 2024 to continue on its stated guide path of fiscal deficit targets. Focus on infrastructure development and measures to enhance Indian manufacturing competitiveness should continue unrelentingly in our view,"" said Sonam Udasi, Senior Fund Manager at Tata Mutual Fund.  4. El Nino, development of monsoonThe El Nino impact is expected till June 2024, potentially impacting monsoon patterns and the cultivation of essential crops, thereby posing a notable threat to the rural economy.    ""The El Nino weather phenomenon, which brought dryness to large parts of Asia this year, is forecast to continue in the first half of 2024, putting at risk supplies of rice, wheat, palm oil and other farm products in some of the world's top agricultural exporters and importers,"" reported Reuters.    The monsoon significantly affects various aspects of India's economy like inflation, rural income, consumer demand, trade, and farming productivity.    Over half of India's population relies on agriculture and related fields for their livelihood. The agricultural sector, contributing approximately 18 per cent to the country's total output, heavily relies on the monsoon for its success.  5. Geopolitical developmentsGeopolitical factors significantly influence investors' risk tolerance by impacting economic stability, causing volatility in stock markets, and triggering fluctuations in currency values.    Apart from the above-mentioned factors, crude oil prices, the movement of the US dollar and bond yields, and government policies are among several other factors that will continue influencing market sentiment in 2024.

Rapid monetary tightening initiated in 2022 may have a significantly greater adverse effect on growth than is presently estimated.

Share of US treasury in RBI reserves shrink, gold sees an increase

",https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/share-of-us-treasury-in-rbi-reserves-shrink-gold-sees-an-increase-11703617584907.html,LiveMint,06:05 AM IST,"
MUMBAI
    : 
     
      The share of US treasury securities in Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) overall foreign exchange reserves shrank in the 12 months to September, while the share of gold holdings rose, data showed, with experts calling it an outcome of revaluation and a rise in holdings.
     
      The data on holdings of US treasury certificates is sourced from the December bulletin of markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which cites the US Department of the Treasury. The aggregate foreign exchange reserves data is from RBI. While India’s total holding of US treasury securities rose 7.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) to $229.1 billion in September, its share in RBI’s aggregate forex reserves shrank about one percentage point to 39%.
     
      On the other hand, the share of gold in total reserves rose to 7.45% at the end of September, as compared to 7.05% in September 2022. The total value of gold in reserves was at $43.7 billion at end-September and has since increased to $47.6 billion as on 15 December.
Mint reported on 19 November that RBI bought nine tonnes of gold in the September quarter, taking India’s official gold reserves to 806.7 tonnes as of September end and placing it at No. 10 in the pecking order, according to miner’s lobby World Gold Council (WGC). India purchased 16.2 tonnes of gold in 2023.
     
      “Central banks continue to buy gold as it has always been part of the reserves and global economic and geo-political context since 2019 imparts a strong case for gold,"" said Somasundaram PR, regional chief executive officer, India, World Gold Council.
     
      India has been diversifying its reserves since 2018, when it purchased 42.3 tonnes, 34.5 tonnes in 2019, 41.7 tonnes in 2020, 77.5 tonnes in 2021 and 33.3 tonnes in 2022. China’s central bank has been at the forefront of this diversification exercise, having purchased a whopping 204 tonnes of gold in 2023, from just 62.2 tonnes last year.
     
      “I would tend to think that this change that we have seen in the holdings of foreign exchange reserves is more as a part of RBI’s diversification strategy. There has been quite a bit of volatility in the last couple of years in terms of the assets held by various central banks, including the dollar which both strengthened and weakened over a period,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda.
     
      Sabnavis said gold prices have seen an upward movement, a phenomenon seen when global conditions are volatile. “I don’t think RBI or other central banks would look to maximize their gains as it is not an important consideration given that returns from these central government bonds are quite low. Instead, the idea is to hold on to reserves which have a stable value,"" he said.
     
      Gold prices rose 11.3% y-o-y to $1848.63 an ounce (31.10 grams) as of 29 September this year, according to data from Bloomberg . This is excluding the import duty of 15% charged by India for bringing gold into the country.
     
      Others expect the value of bonds held by the RBI to increase with global interest rates having peaked. In fact, the US Federal Reserve recently indicated three possible rate cuts in 2024, leading to the US 10-year benchmark bond yield falling below 4%, for the first time since August.
     
      “The base case is for the interest rate cycle to decline in 2024 and a soft landing for the US economy,"" said DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil. “With yields likely to come off, the value of the outstanding treasuries held will also rise.""Download the Mint app and read premium storiesLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Global CuesIn Asian markets, Seoul and Tokyo settled with gains while Shanghai ended lower. Markets in Hong Kong were closed. US and European markets were closed on Monday. European markets remained closed on Tuesday for Boxing Day.    Oil jumped over two per cent on in the previous session to the highest in almost a month, supported by Middle East strife and investor optimism that the US Federal Reserve would soon start cutting interest rates, boosting global economic growth and fuel demand.    The rally - in thin trade with some markets closed for public holidays, added to last week's gains of about three per cent after Houthi attacks on ships disrupted global shipping and trade while the Israel-Hamas conflict shows no sign of easing.    Brent crude futures were up by $1.79, or 2.3 per cent, at $80.86 a barrel and earlier reached $81.23, the highest since December 1. US West Texas Intermediate crude rose by $1.89, or 2.6 per cent, to $75.45, according to news agency Reuters.  Stocks to watch todayShares of Axis Bank and Zee Learn will be in focus during today's session after Axis Bank approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday with a plea seeking insolvency proceeding against Zee Learn.    Additionally, shares of Aditya Birla Capital Ltd will also be in focus as the financial services arm of Aditya Birla Group said on Tuesday that it is infusing  ₹850 crore and  ₹50 crore in its subsidiaries, Aditya Birla Finance Ltd and Aditya Birla Capital Digital Ltd respectively on a rights basis.  F&O Ban ListA total of five stocks – Hindustan Copper, National Aluminium Company Limited, RBL Bank, Balrampur Chini Mills, and Delta Corp have been put under the ban for trade on Wednesday, December 27, under the futures and options (F&O) segment by the National Stock Exchange (NSE). No fresh positions are allowed for any of the F&O contracts in the particular stock when placed under the F&O ban period by the stock exchanges.  Day trading stocks for todayOn intraday stocks for today, stock market experts — Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager - Technical Research at Anand Rathi, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio —recommended six stocks to buy today.  Sumeet Bagadia's intraday stocks for today:1.Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Limited (GMDC): Buy GMDC at  ₹411.40 with a stop loss of  ₹401 at a target price of  ₹430.    GMDC is currently positioned at 411.40 levels, demonstrating technical strength and stability. The stock boasts a robust support zone at 401 levels, aligning closely with its 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). In the daily chart analysis, a minor resistance is noticeable around 420 levels. Upon surpassing this resistance, the stock is poised for an upward trajectory targeting 430 levels and beyond.     The stock's resilience is evident as it trades above short-term (20-Day), medium-term (50-Day), and long-term (200-Day) EMA levels, affirming its overall strength. The Momentum indicator, Relative Strength Index (RSI), has rebounded from lower levels, currently trading at 54, indicating renewed buying interest.     As the stock charts a path towards higher resistances, investors may find opportunities to capitalize on potential upward movements, with a cautious eye on the mentioned support levels and technical indicators for informed decision-making. Based on the above analysis we recommend buying GMDCLTD in cash at CMP of 411.40 for the target of 430 with a stop loss of 401.  2.Tata Chemicals: Buy Tata Chemicals at  ₹1,095 with a stop loss of  ₹1,068 at a target price of  ₹1,155.    Tata Chemicals daily chart analysis reveals a notable shift in market dynamics, transitioning from a period of minor declines and sideways consolidation to a promising upside bounce. The current trading session reflects a up move, potentially signalling an upside breakout from a narrow range momentum. This development aligns with a positive short-term trend, further reinforced by a surge in trading volume.    Key technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), underscore the stock's positive momentum. The RSI not only exhibits positive signals but the stock is also trading above crucial moving averages—specifically, the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). This convergence suggests sustained strength in Tata Chemicals price action.    Volume analysis further substantiates the credibility of the up move, with a pronounced increase accompanying the positive trend. The comprehensive evaluation of Tata Chemicals daily chart implies the existence of a broader bullish pattern in the stock price.     This, in turn, presents a compelling long trading opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on the anticipated upward trajectory. Based on the above analysis we recommend buying Tata Chemicals in cash at CMP of 1,095 for the target of 1,155 with a stop loss of 1,068.

The RSI not only exhibits positive signals but the stock is also trading above crucial moving averages—specifically, the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). This convergence suggests sustained strength in Tata Chemicals price action.    Volume analysis further substantiates the credibility of the up move, with a pronounced increase accompanying the positive trend. The comprehensive evaluation of Tata Chemicals daily chart implies the existence of a broader bullish pattern in the stock price.     This, in turn, presents a compelling long trading opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on the anticipated upward trajectory. Based on the above analysis we recommend buying Tata Chemicals in cash at CMP of 1,095 for the target of 1,155 with a stop loss of 1,068.  Ganesh Dongre's intraday stocks for today:3.Exide Industries: Buy Exide Industries at  ₹297 with a stoploss of  ₹290 at a target price of  ₹305    In the short-term trend, the stock has a bullish reversal pattern, technically retrenchment could be possible till 305 so, holding the support level of 290 this stock can bounce toward the 305 level in the short term, so the trader can go long with a stop loss of 290 for the target price of 305.  4.Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy Kotak Mahindra Bank at  ₹1,887 with a stop loss of  ₹1,870 at a target price of  ₹1,920    On the short-term chart, the stock has shown a bullish reversal pattern, so holding the support level of 1,870. this stock can bounce toward the 1,920 level in the short term, so the trader can go long with a stop loss of 1,870 for the target price of 1,920.  Mitesh Karwa's buy or sell stocks for today:5.Deepak Nitrite: Buying range: Rs. 2,465-2,468; Target Rs. 2,515 | Stop Loss Rs. 2,435    Deepak Nitrite is seen to be breaking out of bullish pattern and closing in green with a bullish candlestick which is why a buy recommendation is initiated for targets upto Rs. 2,515.

On intraday stocks for today, stock market experts — Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager - Technical Research at Anand Rathi, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio —recommended six stocks to buy today. Sumeet Bagadia's intraday stocks for today:1.Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Limited (GMDC): Buy GMDC at  ₹411.40 with a stop loss of  ₹401 at a target price of  ₹430.    GMDC is currently positioned at 411.40 levels, demonstrating technical strength and stability. The stock boasts a robust support zone at 401 levels, aligning closely with its 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). In the daily chart analysis, a minor resistance is noticeable around 420 levels. Upon surpassing this resistance, the stock is poised for an upward trajectory targeting 430 levels and beyond.     The stock's resilience is evident as it trades above short-term (20-Day), medium-term (50-Day), and long-term (200-Day) EMA levels, affirming its overall strength. The Momentum indicator, Relative Strength Index (RSI), has rebounded from lower levels, currently trading at 54, indicating renewed buying interest.     As the stock charts a path towards higher resistances, investors may find opportunities to capitalize on potential upward movements, with a cautious eye on the mentioned support levels and technical indicators for informed decision-making. Based on the above analysis we recommend buying GMDCLTD in cash at CMP of 411.40 for the target of 430 with a stop loss of 401.  2.Tata Chemicals: Buy Tata Chemicals at  ₹1,095 with a stop loss of  ₹1,068 at a target price of  ₹1,155.    Tata Chemicals daily chart analysis reveals a notable shift in market dynamics, transitioning from a period of minor declines and sideways consolidation to a promising upside bounce. The current trading session reflects a up move, potentially signalling an upside breakout from a narrow range momentum. This development aligns with a positive short-term trend, further reinforced by a surge in trading volume.

Contrasting fortunes for new listings

",https://www.livemint.com/market/ipo/contrasting-fortunes-for-new-listings-11703617231163.html,LiveMint,12:35 AM IST," MUMBAI :      The investor reception to three issues that listed on Tuesday was mixed; while Motisons Jewellers Ltd made a stellar debut, Suraj Estates Ltd and Muthoot Microfin elicited a tepid response.   Motisons Jewellers, a diamond and gold jewellery retailer, listed at  ₹109 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE)—a staggering 98.18% premium to its issue price of  ₹55.   It continued to climb, reaching an intraday high of  ₹109.8, before settling at  ₹103.55 on the NSE. The overwhelming demand for Motisons Jewellers shares showed up in an oversubscription of 159.6 times.   The retail portion was bid 122 times.   In contrast, Muthoot Microfin, a microfinance lender, stumbled on its debut day.   Its shares listed at  ₹275.30 on the NSE—a disappointing 5.39% discount to the issue price of  ₹291.   It briefly touched an intraday high of  ₹281 before settling at  ₹266.15, down 8.45% on the NSE. This muted response came as a surprise considering the company’s robust subscription of 11.5 times. However, the retail portion was bid 7.6 times   Analysts attribute this disparity to year-end profit booking, with investors looking to secure gains before entering the new year.   “There appears to be a trend of profit booking among many IPOs, with investors opting to secure their gains as we enter the new year. The focus seems to be more on profit realization rather than fresh buying in these IPOs,"" said Kranthi Bathini, director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities Pvt. Ltd.   Suraj Estate Developers Ltd, a real estate developer, also faced investor skepticism on its debut.   Its shares listed at  ₹340 on the NSE, marking a 5.55% decline compared to the issue price of  ₹360. It reached an intraday high of  ₹354.45 before settling at  ₹334.50, a discount of 7% to the issue price.   While the issue was subscribed 15.6 times, investors copped out at listing.Milestone Alert!

Key events and trends to watch out for in 2024: Part 2

",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/key-events-and-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2024-part-2-11703656633912.html,LiveMint,12:14 PM IST,"
     
      One of India’s most important achievements in 2023 was successfully landing Chandrayaan-3 on the moon in August. The coming year could see India take its space program to the next level with a mission to Venus.
     
      The new year will also see India’s share markets contend with the uncertainty that comes with national elections. The 2024 Olympics will be a test of Indian sports’ growing stature.
     
      Here's the second part of our series on 10 key events to watch out for in 2024.
1. What’s next for Sensex?As central banks shift to a dovish stance, overseas investors are ploughing money back into Indian stocks and benchmark indices have scaled new lifetime highs, with the Sensex crossing 70,000.

     
      Amid this bullish narrative, and with most macroeconomic factors in India's favour, optimism is set to surge in 2024. All eyes are now on the the general elections. Encouraged by the BJP's triumph in recent state polls, markets may shrug off uncertainty if the party returns to power at the centre. Markets love political continuity, and the run-up to the past few elections have delivered smart returns to investors.

     
      The primary market is also getting its groove back, with a string of new offerings awaiting their debut on Dalal Street next year. 



2. The EV raceElectric vehicles (EVs) are growing in popularity as governments push for clean and green mobility. India has made big strides, crossing a million sales in 2022 and hitting the same mark in just the first nine months of 2023.

     
      But the share of EVs in new vehicle purchases has been flat of late as traditional vehicles have retained their dominance. EV growth still relies heavily on three-wheelers.

     
      The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme, which had helped the uptake to some extent, is due to end in March. The government had been reluctant to extend it, citing improper use of the subsidies, but a parliamentary panel has now recommended a three-year extension.

     
      Meanwhile, large automakers such as Tata Motors expect record sales in 2024, and big cities are racing to adopt electric buses. Despite the subsidy row, India is expected to become one the world's largest EV markets. 



3. China at 75India’s biggest and increasingly most consequential neighbour, China will complete 75 years of rule by a one-party communist regime on 1 October. In 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the formation of the People’s Republic of China at Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, ending a two-decade-long bloody civil war between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang.

     
      After decades of failed experiments, the country’s economy has been on an extraordinary growth path since the 1980s, intimidating the West and gaining sway over the global south, even as concerns remain over its restrictive regime.

     
      The world’s second-biggest economy and a manufacturing powerhouse has lifted over 800 million out of poverty. It's now an upper-middle-income country and close to high-income status. But its economy has struggled to rebound since it dropped its strict zero-covid restrictions. Worryingly, China also has a declining population. The next 75 years may not be the same as the past 75 for the Chinese juggernaut. 



4. Deeper into spaceThe new year will see the launch of the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO’s) ambitious Venus Orbiter Mission, tentatively scheduled for December. This endeavour follows the triumphs of ISRO's historic 2023 missions, namely Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya L1.

     
      The Venus mission, unofficially known as Shukrayaan, holds immense promise in shaping India's space-exploration narrative. Its primary objective is to delve beneath the surface of Venus, the solar system's hottest planet, and investigate the mysteries hidden under its sulphuric-acid clouds. It will also scour Venus's atmosphere for oxygen.

     
      A successful mission would put ISRO in an elite group of entities that have sent missions to Venus: the Soviet Union, the US, Europe and Japan. Other significant space missions on which ISRO may provide updates in 2024 are Gaganyaan (a human spaceflight programme), and Mangalyaan 2 (second Mars mission). 



5. Paris OlympicsFrance claims the upcoming summer Olympics in Paris will be the cheapest so far this century. The government has said the private sector is funding a large part of it and that public coffers will only contribute a quarter of the total cost. 



     
      Previous Olympics have left a large hole in finances of host countries. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, is considered to be the most expensive to date, costing $59.7 billion. High costs have deterred several countries from even bidding for the Olympics. A dearth of candidates for the 2024 games prompted the International Olympic Committee to choose the 2024 and 2028 host cities at one go. France’s promises will be put to test in 2024 after a long streak of high living costs. There are already concerns that cost overruns could inflate the taxpayers' contribution.  As central banks shift to a dovish stance, overseas investors are ploughing money back into Indian stocks and benchmark indices have scaled new lifetime highs, with the Sensex crossing 70,000.
     
      Amid this bullish narrative, and with most macroeconomic factors in India's favour, optimism is set to surge in 2024. All eyes are now on the the general elections. Encouraged by the BJP's triumph in recent state polls, markets may shrug off uncertainty if the party returns to power at the centre. Markets love political continuity, and the run-up to the past few elections have delivered smart returns to investors.
     
      The primary market is also getting its groove back, with a string of new offerings awaiting their debut on Dalal Street next year.
2. The EV raceElectric vehicles (EVs) are growing in popularity as governments push for clean and green mobility. India has made big strides, crossing a million sales in 2022 and hitting the same mark in just the first nine months of 2023.

     
      But the share of EVs in new vehicle purchases has been flat of late as traditional vehicles have retained their dominance. EV growth still relies heavily on three-wheelers.

     
      The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme, which had helped the uptake to some extent, is due to end in March. The government had been reluctant to extend it, citing improper use of the subsidies, but a parliamentary panel has now recommended a three-year extension.

     
      Meanwhile, large automakers such as Tata Motors expect record sales in 2024, and big cities are racing to adopt electric buses. Despite the subsidy row, India is expected to become one the world's largest EV markets. 



3. China at 75India’s biggest and increasingly most consequential neighbour, China will complete 75 years of rule by a one-party communist regime on 1 October. In 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the formation of the People’s Republic of China at Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, ending a two-decade-long bloody civil war between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang.

     
      After decades of failed experiments, the country’s economy has been on an extraordinary growth path since the 1980s, intimidating the West and gaining sway over the global south, even as concerns remain over its restrictive regime.

     
      The world’s second-biggest economy and a manufacturing powerhouse has lifted over 800 million out of poverty. It's now an upper-middle-income country and close to high-income status. But its economy has struggled to rebound since it dropped its strict zero-covid restrictions. Worryingly, China also has a declining population. The next 75 years may not be the same as the past 75 for the Chinese juggernaut.

Ayodhya's Ram Mandir complex will be 'atmanirbhar' and have 70% green cover

",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/ayodhyas-ram-mandir-complex-will-be-atmanirbhar-and-have-70-green-cover-temple-trust-take-a-sneak-peek-11703656082753.html,LiveMint,11:41 AM IST,"      Most of the Ram temple compound will be a green area with hundreds of trees and the complex itself will be ""atmanirbhar"", the temple trust said underlining features like its own sewage and water treatment plants, a fire brigade post and a dedicated power line.   About 70% of the 70-acre complex will be a green area, Ram temple trust general secretary Champat Rai told reporters here on Tuesday.   ""The green area includes portions which are very dense, and in some segments of it, even sunlight hardly filters through,"" he said. About 600 existing trees are preserved in the green belt.   In a presentation to the media, Rai said the temple complex will be ""atmanirbhar' (self-reliant) in its own way, and will not put any burden on the Ayodhya municipal body's sewage or drainage system.   The complex will have two STPs (sewage treatment plants, one WTP (water treatment plant) and a dedicated electricity line from the power house. A fire brigade post there will be able to source water from an underground reservoir, he said.   The first phase of the temple is nearing completion, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take part in the “pran pratishtha,"" or the consecration ceremony of the Ram Lalla idol, on January 22.   Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya visited the office of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, located at Ramkot in Ayodhya.   Modi will also visit the temple town on December 30 to inaugurate the redeveloped Ayodhya railway station and a new airport. He will also address a rally, officials said earlier.   ""Preparations are in full swing for his visit. We are all geared up,"" Maurya told PTI.   A panoramic image of the upcoming temple, as envisaged, is displayed in the lobby of the trust’s office. Rai accompanied journalists to the temple construction site after a presentation of Ram Mandir landscape plan.   ""The entry into the temple will be from the east side, and exit from the south side. The entire temple superstructure will eventually be three storeys -- G 2,"" he said.   Visitors will climb 32 steps from the eastern side to reach the main temple.   The temple complex, built in the traditional Nagara style, will be 380 feet long (east-west direction), 250 feet wide and 161 feet high, he said.   Each floor of the temple will be 20 ft high and have a total of 392 pillars and 44 gates, he added.   The grand temple will have a rectangular periphery called 'percota', a feature that is found in temples in South India, but generally not in the north, he said.   The 'percota' will be 14-foot wide and this periphery will span 732 metres, Rai said.   The four corners of the 'percota' will be dedicated to Sun God, Maa Bhagwati, Lord Ganesha and Lord Shiva.   A shrine dedicated to Maa Annapurna will be constructed on the northern side. On the southern side, there will be shrine for Lord Hanuman, Rai said.   Seven other shrines are planned in the complex, dedicated to Maharshi Valmiki, Maharshi Vashisht, Maharshi Vishwamitra, Maharshi Agastya, Nishad Raj, Mata Shabri and Devi Ahilya -- all associated with Lord Ram's life.   And an idol of Jatayu has been installed at Ayodhya’s Kuber Tila. ""An ancient Shiva temple that exists on Kuber Tila has also been revitalised,"" Rai said.   On Tuesday, when PTI visited the construction site, labourers were busy chiselling stone slabs, giving finishes touches ahead of the consecration ceremony.   The auspicious time for the consecration, according to Rai, would be between noon and 12.15 pm.   On Tuesday, a large number of people visited the Ram Janmabhoomi site to have a 'darshan' of the deity – the old idol of Ram Lalla that is housed in a makeshift shrine -- as construction activity continued nearby.   The complex will also have a lift and two ramps at the entrance for the elderly and people with disabilities.   There will be a pilgrim facilitation complex with a healthcare centre and a toilet block. Before their ‘darshan’, 25,000 people will be able to deposit their shoes, watches and mobile phones.   A pathway has been built for emergency situations.   Rai said that a statue of Jatayu has been installed at Kuber Tila in Ayodhya, and an ancient Shiva temple already there has been revitalised,"" he added.   The Supreme Court delivered a historic verdict in 2019, settling a temple-mosque dispute that went over a century back.   The court backed the construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site, and ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for building a mosque.Milestone Alert!

China imposes sanctions on US data firm

",https://www.livemint.com/news/world/china-imposes-sanctions-on-us-data-firm-11703656616138.html,LiveMint,11:33 AM IST,"
     
      China’s government hit back at U.S. criticism of its human-rights record on Tuesday by imposing sanctions on a Los Angeles firm and two analysts involved in scouring the country’s supply chain for abuses.
     
      Beijing said the actions under its Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law will be applied to Kharon, a research and data analytics firm, in response to its work monitoring Xinjiang, a far western region of China where the U.S. government, Western media and independent researchers have documented human-rights abuses against ethnic minorities, including primarily Muslim Uyghurs.
     
      China’s government linked the sanctions with U.S. policy moves. “We again urge the U.S. side to stop smearing China, cancel the illegal unilateral sanctions on Chinese officials and companies, and stop implementing wrongful acts such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a Beijing news briefing, in announcing the action. Beijing denies mistreatment of minorities in its population.
     
      Mao said Beijing’s actions were “countermeasures"" in response to a recent State Department annual report on human-rights conditions in Xinjiang, which prompted new U.S. sanctions on two Chinese officials and three companies. In an early December report to Congress, the State Department referred to a range of “ongoing human-rights abuses,"" including torture, in Xinjiang against ethnic and religious minorities. The State Department didn’t respond to a request for comment.
     
      The government in China has reacted angrily to U.S. penalties against its officials and companies in response to human-rights conditions in Xinjiang, as well as Hong Kong and Tibet. Unlike American sanctions that can make it difficult for a target to travel internationally or retain banking services, China’s countermeasures have a limited impact because they have often hit individuals, companies and think tanks with little to no activity in China. Some of those sanctioned in the past by China include American military contractors Lockheed Martin and an arm of RTX plus former U.S. officials and think-tank researchers.
     
      The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Kharon has long collected sensitive information related to Xinjiang and provided “so-called evidence for America’s illegal sanctions.""
     
      Under the sanctions, Kharon and the researchers will have any assets in China frozen. The researchers will be banned from entering China and the measures “prohibit organizations and individuals in China from transactions and cooperation with them."" Kharon’s website displays logos of a range of U.S. and multinational corporations as organizations that trust its work.
     
      The targeted researchers included Edmund Xu, who leads Kharon’s Asia research program, and Nicole Morgret, a longtime Xinjiang specialist now at the U.S.-China Economic And Security Review Commission, which advises Congress, and formerly with the Center for Advanced Defense Studies and Uyghur Human Rights Project.
     
      Kharon has published a number of reports that link Xinjiang production, a red flag for possible forced labor, to Chinese supply chains in the seafood, polysilicon and beer businesses.
     
      In a statement, Kharon noted that other U.S. businesses, organizations and people have faced similar sanctions by China and said it would continue to serve its clients. Kharon also said it disputes how China’s Foreign Ministry characterized its work, which the firm says is based on open-source information. The firm said Xu is unavailable. Morgret couldn’t be reached.
     
      Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, which noted that one of its co-founders is among those already sanctioned by China, said Beijing’s latest move “is part of a longer pattern of attempts to deter investigations and silence critical voices and activists working to uncover human rights abuses in China.""

Over 25 hospitalised after Ammonia gas leak from Chennai fertilizer unit

The incident took place at about 11.45 pm on December 26.    Following the gas leakage from the plant, an odor that caused discomfort spread across the neighborhood, according to a report published by the news agency PTI.    Over 25 people in residential neighborhoods such as Periya Kuppam in the vicinity of the manufacturing facility experienced unease, nausea, and faintness and they were taken to nearby hospitals, sources added.   As soon as word spread about the gas leak, people rushed out of their homes in panic, gathered on roads, and sought help. At the same time, officials of the fertilizer unit ‘took steps to rectify the technical issue’, the sources said as quoted by PTI.    Police personnel pacified people by telling them that experts were addressing the issue and requested them to go back to their homes as 'there is no problem'.   On Wednesday, people held a protest after an ammonia gas leak was detected in a sub-sea pipe in Ennore. DIG, Joint Commissioner Avadi, Vijayakumar said, ""There are no more gas (ammonia) leaks at Ennore. People are back home. Medical and police teams are present at the spot.""   Amir Alvi, President and Head of Manufacturing (Fertiliser) and Supply Chain at Coromandel International Limited said that the company noticed an abnormality in the ammonia unloading subsea pipeline near the shoreside, outside the plant premises.    “Our Standard Operating Procedure activated immediately, and we have isolated the ammonia system facility and brought the situation to normalcy in the shortest time,"" Alvi said in an official statement.    “During the process, a few members of the local community expressed discomfort and were given medical attention immediately. We have informed relevant authorities about the incident. Coromandel has always adhered to the highest safety standards and emergency response system,"" he added. Milestone Alert!

Lee Sun-kyun of Oscar-winning film ‘Parasite’ found dead, suicide suspected

",https://www.livemint.com/news/world/actor-lee-sun-kyun-of-oscar-winning-film-parasite-found-dead-suicide-suspected-11703651340730.html,LiveMint,11:55 AM IST,"      Actor Lee Sun-kyun, best known for his role in the Oscar-winning film ""Parasite"", was found dead on Wednesday in an apparent suicide, Yonhap news agency has reported. As per the report, the police said that the actor was discovered inside a vehicle at a park in central Seoul.   This occurred when the 48-year-old was being looked into by the police for possible marijuana and other psychotropic substance use.   The actor had faced police questioning three times over accusations of illegal drug use amid a government crackdown, with one session running 19 hours over the weekend. The actor had said he was tricked into taking drugs by a bar hostess trying to blackmail him, the Yonhap news agency reported.   Authorities found Lee in a search triggered by the report that he was missing, a fire official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, as the matter is a sensitive one. Earlier, citing police, Yonhap reported that Lee was found in a car at a park in Seoul, after his manager told police the actor had left home, leaving an apparent suicide note.

Sunehri Bagh masjid row: ‘With Mosque will go all this history’, netizens react

",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/sunehri-bagh-masjid-demolition-with-mosque-will-go-all-this-history-netizens-react-11703643265179.html,LiveMint,08:53 AM IST,"      After the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) asked for public opinion on the mosque's proposed demolition, the discussion surrounding Sunehri Bagh Masjid, near the Parliament, has picked up steam. As per a 2009 notification of the Delhi government, the masjid has been designated as a Grade-III Heritage structure.   NDMC on Sunday issued a notice to invite citizens' objections and suggestions in this matter by January 1, Indian Express reported, adding that so far, more than 300 suggestions have been received via mail, of which, mostly opposed the demolition.   The Delhi Waqf Board asserts that they own the land on which the mosque is situated, but the NDMC claims that the government owns the land.   Officials had stated that the mosque was causing traffic jams in the area. However, Sunehri Bagh Masjid’s Imam Abdul Aziz opposed the claims of traffic congestion in the area, calling the notification “illegal and arbitrary"", as per Indian Express reports.   In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Kishanganj MP Dr. Mohammad Jawed strongly objected to the NDMC’s notification. “I raise the strongest objection to the proposed demolition of Sunehri Mosque and urge@tweetndmc to devise an alternative plan to save this site of immense cultural importance and heritage!""   Indian historian Rana Safvi stated that Sunehri Bagh masjid is a mosque in which Maulana Hasrat Mohani stayed when attending Parliament sessions, and refused government accommodation plus salary and allowances given to MPs.   “Maulana Hasrat Mohani traveled to and from parliament on a bicycle or in a shared Tonga to attend Parliament sessions. He was the first to move the resolution for complete independence in the 1931 Congress Session. It was he who coined the slogan Inquilab Zindabad. With the Mosque will go all this history. via Sohail Hashmi sb,"" she wrote on the microblogging site.    Author Sohail Hashmi, as quoted by Indian Express, said that the mosque housed freedom fighters like Syed Fazl-ul-Hasan, known by his pen-name Hasrat Mohani.    “Mohani had moved the resolution for complete independence from British rule which was accepted by the Indian National Congress in 1921 and he coined the famous slogan ‘Inquilab Zindabad’. The legacy of a nationalist and the history will be destroyed with the demolition of the mosque,"" the author said. Milestone Alert!

Kochadaiiyaan case: ‘Humiliation and harassment’, says Rajinikanth’s wife Latha

She appeared before a Bengaluru court on Tuesday in a matter pertaining to the Tamil film 'Kochadaiiyaan'. The court granted her bail and the hearing has been postponed to January 6.   “For me, it's a case of humiliation and harassment and exploitation of a popular person. This is the price we pay for being celebrities. So there may not be a big case, but the news becomes very big. There is no fraudulence...I have nothing to do with the money…,"" Latha told ANI.   The Supreme Court on 10 October restored alleged criminal charges against Superstar Rajinikanth's wife Latha in a matter about the Tamil film 'Kochadaiiyaan'. A bench headed by Justice AS Bopanna and MM Sundresh passed the order while hearing petitions challenging the Karnataka High Court judgment.   The SC had asked Latha to seek the trial court to have accusations of forgery and cheating against her in a criminal case dismissed. Chennai-based Ad Bureau Advertising Pvt Ltd had challenged the Karnataka HC's order which had quashed the cheating case against Rajnikanth's wife.   The impugned order dated August 2, 2022, passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru, has been challenged by both the contesting parties.   Earlier in August, the Karnataka HC had given some relief to Latha, by quashing the cheating charges against her but had maintained the forgery cases against her. She also challenged the HC decision in the Supreme Court.    Tamil film Kochadiiyaan was produced by Ad Bureau and Mediaone Global Entertainment Limited which starred Rajinikanth and Deepika Padukone. The movie was also the directorial debut of Rajinikanth’s daughter Soundarya.Milestone Alert!

Apple files emergency request to halt US ban on watch imports

",https://www.livemint.com/news/apple-files-emergency-request-to-halt-us-ban-on-watch-imports-11703640502089.html,LiveMint,07:16 AM IST,"      Apple on Tuesday appealed a decision to ban imports of its watches based on a complaint from medical monitoring technology company Masimo, after U.S. President Joe Biden's administration declined to veto a government tribunal.   The tech giant also filed an emergency request on Tuesday for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt the ban.   It asked the Federal Circuit to pause the ban at least until U.S. Customs and Border Protection decides whether redesigned versions of its watches infringe Masimo's patents, and to put the ban on hold while the court considers Apple's request. The customs office is due to make its decision on Jan. 12, Apple said.   Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into the popular Apple Watch.   The U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) order bars imports and sales of Apple Watches that use technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Apple has included the pulse oximeter feature in its smart watches starting with its Series 6 model in 2020.   U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai decided not to reverse the ban following careful consultations, and the ITC's decision became final on Dec. 26, the Trade Representative's office said on Tuesday.   An Apple spokesperson said the company has appealed the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.   ""We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order, and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible,"" Apple said in a statement on Tuesday.   The ITC last week rejected Apple's request to pause the ban during the appeal process and opposed Apple's request for the Federal Circuit to halt the ban in a court filing on Tuesday.   A Masimo spokesperson called the ITC decision ""a win for the integrity of the U.S. patent system, and ultimately American consumers.""   While companies usually settle such disputes, Apple may think it can design around the patents quickly or remove the infringing feature, said Nicholas Matich, an intellectual property attorney with law firm McKool Smith.   ""There's nothing legally extraordinary about the ITC issuing an exclusion order,"" Matich said. ""What's extraordinary here is that the product at issue is high profile and that Apple has chosen to live with the ITC order rather than settle.""   Stifel analysts said in a note that their litigation expert predicted a potential Apple appeal would extend the ""final"" ITC case verdict roughly another year.   Apple has paused its sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the United States since last week, though the watches remain available from other retailers including Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart as of Tuesday.   The ban does not affect Apple Watch SE, a less-expensive model, which will continue to be sold. Previously sold watches will not be affected by the ban.   A jury trial on Masimo's allegations in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May. Apple has separately sued Masimo for patent infringement in federal court in Delaware and has called Masimo's legal actions a ""maneuver to clear a path"" for its own competing smart watch.   A presidential administration has not vetoed an ITC ruling since 2013, when President Barack Obama's administration overturned an import ban on Apple's iPhones and iPads in the company's patent dispute with Samsung.   The Biden administration in February chose not to veto a separate import ban on Apple Watches based on a patent-infringement complaint from medical technology company AliveCor. The ITC has placed the ban on hold for other reasons.   Apple's wearables, home and accessory business, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods earbuds and other products, brought in $8.28 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2023, according to a company report.

""There was no damage to ships in the area or reported injuries,"" the Pentagon's Central Command said in a social media post, describing a barrage of 12 drones, three anti-ship ballistic missiles and two land-attack missiles over a period of 10 hours. Also Read | Rise of pirates in Red Sea to take toll on India’s exim business. Here are items that will turn costlier   Earlier, Houthi rebels announced that they were behind the missile strike on a vessel in the Red Sea and a drone attack toward Israel in solidarity with Gaza.   In a statement, the Houthi rebels said they ""carried out a targeting operation against a commercial ship"" they identified as MSC UNITED, and launched a number of ""drones against military targets"" in southern Israel.   The attacks are the latest development of drone and missile strikes launched by the rebels since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7.   The Houthis claimed that they are targeting Israel and Israeli-linked vessels to push for a stop to the offensive in the Gaza Strip, where Israel is battling Hamas militants.   Also earlier on December 26, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said ""explosions (were) heard, missiles were sighted"" near the port of Hodeida on Yemen's west coast, adding that a transiting vessel and its crew were safe, according to a report by AFP.   The vessel proceeded with its journey after the incident, as reported by UKMTO, without indicating any significant damage or injuries to the crew.   Earlier on Tuesday, two additional explosions happened in the vicinity of a vessel off Hodeida, as confirmed by the British maritime authority.   Simultaneously, explosions were audible off the coast of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula on Tuesday, as reported by Egyptian state-linked media. Subsequently, the Israeli army disclosed that it had intercepted airborne objects in the Red Sea.   ""An air force fighter jet successfully intercepted earlier today in the Red Sea area a hostile aerial target that was on its way to Israeli territory,"" the army said, as per the report.   Al-Qahera News television channel, which has links to state intelligence, had said the blasts occurred about two kilometres (1.2 miles) from the Egyptian seaside town of Dahab, the report further added.   Dahab lies around 125 kilometres (75 miles) south of Eilat on the southern tip of Israel, the closest target for Yemen's rebels.   ""We heard a loud explosion coming from the direction of the sea, and then we saw a strange object falling into the water,"" an eyewitness told AFP.   As per the Pentagon, the Houthis have executed over 100 drone and missile strikes, aiming at 10 merchant vessels from more than 35 diverse nations. These attacks pose a threat to a crucial transit route responsible for up to 12 per cent of worldwide trade. As a precautionary measure, the United States had established a multinational naval task force to safeguard shipping in the Red Sea.   Additionally, the Houthis have initiated a series of assaults towards Israel, with the majority falling short of hitting their intended targets.    Milestone Alert!

The central government on Friday ordered a ban on non-essential construction work and plying of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers in Delhi-NCR amid worsening air quality in the region.   A Sub-Committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), a statutory body responsible for planning air pollution mitigation measures in Delhi-NCR, reviewed the situation on Saturday, the Environment Ministry said.   Observing that GRAP Stage III curbs were implemented only a day ago, the committee decided to wait and observe the impact of the measures implemented under Stage III before considering more severe actions under Stage IV, it said.   The Graded Action Response Plan (GRAP), the central government's air pollution control plan for Delhi-NCR, categorizes actions into four stages: Stage I - Poor (AQI 201-300); Stage II - Very Poor (AQI 301-400); Stage III - Severe (AQI 401-450); and Stage IV - Severe Plus (AQI above 450).Milestone Alert!

Israel-Hamas War Day 82: Biden and Qatari Emir discuss hostage release

",https://www.livemint.com/news/world/israelhamas-war-day-82-biden-and-qatari-emir-discuss-hostage-release-83-trucks-of-aid-enter-gaza-top-10-updates-11703637492134.html,LiveMint,06:27 AM IST,"      US President Joe Biden and Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani on Tuesday discussed the need to release hostages held in Gaza and efforts to boost humanitarian aid, the White House said. Qatar and Egypt were mediators between Israel and the militant group Hamas in the late November truce.    ""The two leaders discussed the urgent effort to secure the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas, including American citizens,"" the White House readout said, adding they also talked about increasing access to aid. Here are top 10 updates on Israel-Hamas war,    1) On Tuesday, 83 humanitarian aid trucks and seven ambulances were inspected at the Nitzana checkpoint and transferred to Gaza via the Rafah Crossing from Egypt, ANI reported.    2) The United Nations also named a coordinator to oversee humanitarian relief shipments into Gaza as part of a UN Security Council resolution adopted on Friday to boost humanitarian aid.   3) Sigrid Kaag, the Netherlands' outgoing finance minister, will be the senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza starting on January 8, the UN said in a statement as quoted by Reuters.    4) Palestinian health authorities in Hamas-ruled Gaza say nearly 21,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes, with more feared buried under rubble. Nearly all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes, many several times.   5) After Hamas killed 1,200 people and captured 240 hostages on October 7, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded with an assault that has laid much of Gaza to waste.   6) Israel's war on Hamas will last months, Israel's military chief said, as a string of incidents outside the Gaza Strip highlighted the risk of the conflict spreading, as per Reuters reports.    7) “There are no magic solutions, there are no shortcuts in dismantling a terrorist organization, only determined and persistent fighting. We will reach Hamas' leadership too, whether it takes a week or if it takes months,"" said Israel's Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi.    8) Israeli actions intensified around Christmas, particularly in a central area just south of the seasonal waterway that bisects the Gaza Strip. The Israeli army told civilians to leave the area, though many said there was no safe place left to go.   9) Gaza authorities buried 80 unidentified Palestinians on Tuesday whose bodies were handed over by Israel through the Kerem Shalom border crossing, the health ministry said.   10) The United States has openly pressed Israel in recent weeks to scale down its war to a more targeted operation of raids on Hamas leaders. But Washington is still seen in the region as a supporter of Israel and US forces have been attacked by Iran-backed militants in the Middle East.     (With inputs from agencies)Milestone Alert!

Bharat rice coming soon, at ₹25 a kilo

",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/bharat-rice-coming-soon-at-25-a-kilo-11703611957536.html,LiveMint,06:00 AM IST,"
NEW DELHI
    : 
     
      After Bharat atta (wheat flour) and Bharat dal (pulses), the Centre is now planning to sell Bharat rice at discounted rates to contain rising cereal prices ahead of next year’s general elections, a senior official said.
     
      Bharat rice could be offered at  ₹25 a kg through government agencies, such as the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed), National Cooperative Consumers’ Federation of India Ltd (NCCF), Kendriya Bhandar outlets and mobile vans, the official said on the condition of anonymity.
     
       
     
      The move comes at a time the all-India average retail price of rice has touched  ₹43.3 a kg, up 14.1% from a year ago, according to latest consumer affairs ministry data.
     
      On the rationale behind the plan, the official said, “There is always one motive: curtailing prices and, thus, inflation.""
     
      Queries sent to the consumer affairs, food and public distribution ministry remained unanswered till the press time.
     
       
     
      Currently, the government sells wheat flour and chana dal (split chickpeas) to consumers under the Bharat brand at concessional rates of  ₹27.50 a kg and  ₹60 a kg, respectively. These cereals are sold at more than 2,000 retail points amid concerns over tight supply, which has kept domestic prices firm. The process of selling Bharat rice will be the same as of Bharat dal and atta, the official said.
     
      The government has also initiated subsidized retail sales of onion at  ₹25 a kg through various channels, including Safal, the grocery chain of Mother Dairy, which is a subsidiary of the National Dairy Development Board.
     
       
     
      In the past few months, the government has taken several steps to stabilize prices of essential food grains, while also ensuring fair prices for farmers.
     
      The government banned exports of non-basmati rice in July and imposed an export floor price of $1,200 per tonne for basmati exports in August, which was lowered to $950 a tonne later. Under the Open Market Sales Scheme (OMSS), the Food Corporation of India (FCI) is offering 400,000 tonnes of rice for sale at  ₹29-29.73 per kg in its weekly e-auctions to increase availability of rice in the domestic market.
     
      In its latest auction, FCI could sell 13,164 tonnes of rice against the 193,000 tonnes offered. The government at present has 17.9 million tonnes (mt) of rice in the central pool as against the 7.6 mt norm as of 1 January.
     
      Cereal prices rose 10.3% in November, pushing up food inflation to 8.7% in November from 6.61% in October. Food inflation accounts for nearly half of the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI).
     
      Last month, S&P Global Commodity Insights said the El Nino weather event may adversely impact rainfall during the winter of 2023, affecting key rabi crops such as wheat, which could raise cereal inflation further.
     
      The launch of subsidized food grains shows India’s economic growth figures do not represent the situation at the bottom of the pyramid, said Devendra Pant, chief economist, India Ratings.
     
      “At the top end of the pyramid, income and consumption growth is good, which is not there at the other end of the pyramid. It is a bit perplexing that the government had to come up with Bharat atta even after the free foodgrain distribution. Dal is understandable, but atta means there are still some people who are not part of the free foodgrain distribution scheme. These are all anecdotal, and suggest that the situation is not very good for the people who come under the lower income bracket,"" Pant said.
     
      “Two commodities—cereals, and pulses and products—have structural issues with inflation, and contribute to inflation. Cereal prices have been in double digits for a year or so,"" he said.
     
      It is unclear why wheat prices are rising since a ban on exports and government stock offloading have increased domestic supplies, Pant added.
     
      “CPI will gradually come down to 4% by the end of next fiscal, but inflation is seen averaging at 5.2-5.3% at least this fiscal,"" Pant said.Download the Mint app and read premium storiesLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

India to initiate strict action against Red Sea attackers: Rajnath Singh

",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-to-initiate-strict-action-against-red-sea-attackers-rajnath-singh-11703616170248.html,LiveMint,12:16 AM IST," NEW DELHI :      Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, has vowed to take decisive action against those responsible for the assaults on the India-linked shipping vessels, MV Chem Pluto and MV Sai Baba, amid escalating tensions in the Red Sea region.   For over a month, attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on vessels using the crucial Red Sea shipping route have heightened uncertainty in the global economy. “The recent drone attacks on the MV Chem Pluto in the Arabian Sea and a few days ago on the MV Sai Baba in the Red Sea have been taken very seriously by the Indian government. The Navy has increased its surveillance of the seas. Whoever has carried out this attack, we will find them even from the bottom of the seas and strict action will be taken against them,"" said Singh on Tuesday.   The Houthis, who are involved in Yemen’s civil conflict, initiated the assaults on shipping vessels with links to Israel, and announced their intention to retaliate against Tel Aviv for its military actions in Gaza, which caused thousands of casualties. Since mid-November, attacks have disrupted shipping along the Red Sea, an important maritime route linking Asian and European economies through the Suez Canal.   In response, several global shipping majors have temporarily halted operations. Two attacks on India-linked ships—on Saturday against MV Chem Pluto in the Arabian Sea and on Sunday against MV Sai Baba in the Red Sea— squarely caught India’s attention, given that Indian crew members were on board both ships. The MV Chem Pluto was transporting crude oil from Saudi Arabia to Mangalore.   The US said the drone attack on MV Chem Pluto had originated from Iran. For its part, Tehran has denied deep military involvement with the Houthis. However, Iran maintained close ties with the group and has backed them in the ongoing Yemeni civil war.   Singh emphasized India’s position as a security provider in the region and pledged to collaborate with other nations to ensure the security of maritime commerce. In reaction to the Houthi attacks, the US has declared the formation of multinational maritime coalition to restore stability along the Red Sea corridor. “Operation Prosperity Guardian is bringing together multiple countries to include the UK, Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Seychelles and Spain, to jointly address security challenges in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, with the goal of ensuring freedom of navigation for all countries and bolstering regional security and prosperity,"" US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said last week.   The operation was announced by the Combined Maritime Force, a multinational naval coalition. India began formal cooperation with the task force in 2022, and was invited to send a naval officer to its headquarters in Bahrain, but it is yet to join. The external affairs ministry has confirmed ‘communications’ regarding the development.   “We have a vested interest and are supportive of the free movement of commercial shipping. That is something we’re interested in. We are monitoring developments there,"" MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said about India’s approach to the Red Sea crisis. Following the attacks on the ship, an Indian coast guard escort was sent to accompany MV Chem Pluto to Mumbai, the ministry said.Milestone Alert!

Beware of Scams: Tips for safely investing in the digital world

",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/beware-of-scams-tips-for-safely-investing-in-the-digital-world-11703641777492.html,LiveMint,07:27 AM IST,"      Today’s digital world is the most egalitarian and the most vulnerable space in the world. One may grow and may perish also. This is truer when it comes to the financial world.    Digital work has made the financial markets more accessible even to investors who were not inclined to invest in the markets. The digital world is cost-efficient.    This provides a strong and convincing argument to invest in the markets. But what looks simple is too simplistic. Some people indulge in fraudulent practices and ensnare inexperienced investors.   Hence, it is important to understand the challenges involved in investing in the markets through the various avenues available. Dummy portals and appsNowadays most investors start their journey in the digital world. Even the opening of an account and Know-Your-Client (KYC) compliance are carried out online.     In most cases individuals get the link or name of the ‘mobile application’ or the portal URL from an acquaintance or through social media.     This is an important step where investors have to be extra careful. They should check if they are downloading the right app or visiting the official website of a service provider.     Sometimes online scamsters build a web portal or mobile application that resembles the official one.     Transacting on such portals or apps can lead to the compromising of the vital data of an investor. An investor may lose money also.    A prudent approach will be to identify the official website and type the website link (URL-uniform resource locator) in the web browser.     Scamsters, many times, send out a link that leads to a portal which has a domain that looks the same but has jumbled a letter or two which takes it to a fake website.     For example, instead of www.avoidfraudsters.com, one may end up clicking avoidfraudstars.com and reach a different website.    While looking for a mobile application, it makes sense to download the same from the Google Play Store or the App Store.     Never use a link received from an unknown source to download a software or mobile application.     Sometimes fraudsters create look-alike apps as well. Using such apps means allowing scamsters access to money.    In the case an investor gets a message which states that a broker has asked for a KYC update or launch of a new mobile application, then before acting on such moves, do call up the official contact centre and confirm the same.

Investors need to check if there is a connection between a successful trader whose name is being used and the services on offer.     Also, check if a person has the necessary license to carry out advisory services.     Only, SEBI-registered entities can offer services such as money management, advisory or financial services distribution.     There must be a written contract between an investor and the service provider for such services.

5 key macro themes that will influence the market in 2024

",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/5-key-macro-themes-that-will-influence-the-market-in-2024-11703606015459.html,LiveMint,07:04 AM IST,"      The Indian economy shone brightly as a standout performer in 2023 amid elevated interest rates, persistent inflation, weakening demand, and geopolitical tensions, while numerous other major economies grappled with difficulties.   The robustness of the Indian economy has been the key driving force behind the strong performance of the Indian market this year; equity benchmark Nifty 50 has risen over 18 per cent this year so far.   Apart from the domestic economy, geopolitical developments, movement in the US dollar and bond yields, crude oil prices, etc. were some of the key macro themes that affected market sentiment in 2023.   Let's take a look at some key macro themes that will affect domestic market sentiment in 2024.   Also Read: Nifty 50 set to clock healthy double-digit gains in 2023; what are the key challenges for the market in 2024? 5 key macro themes that will influence the market in 20241. Central banks' movesMajor central banks of the world, including the US Fed and the RBI, are expected to trim interest rates in the coming year. However, the timing and the extent of rate cuts will be the key factors. Furthermore, how central banks evaluate inflation and growth will significantly impact market sentiment.  2. General Elections 2024India will most likely see General Elections in April-May. A stable government post-election is anticipated and would be favourably received by the domestic market. While an NDA victory might not result in a substantial market upsurge, its defeat could prompt a swift, short-term reaction. Nevertheless, the market is expected to eventually refocus on fundamental aspects and corporate earnings.    ""With recent big wins in MP, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan state elections, the likelihood of NDA coming to power again in 2024 has increased substantially. We don’t think the 2024 win will trigger any sharp rally in the market, it will just be business as usual. A loss though can cause an immediate negative reaction in the markets,"" said Ashutosh Tiwari, Managing Director and Head of Institutional Equities at Equirus.    ""Foundations laid by the current government in infrastructure, manufacturing, import substitution, etc., are going to fuel economic growth over the medium term and hence barring short-term reactions, we don’t see any risk of a steep correction in the markets,"" said Tiwari.  (Exciting news! Mint is now on WhatsApp Channels. Subscribe today and stay updated with the latest financial insights! Click here!)  3. Budget 2024The Budget in February will be a Vote on Account ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. However, after the government is formed, the July Budget will be a key macro event for the market.    ""We expect the Budget 2024 to continue on its stated guide path of fiscal deficit targets. Focus on infrastructure development and measures to enhance Indian manufacturing competitiveness should continue unrelentingly in our view,"" said Sonam Udasi, Senior Fund Manager at Tata Mutual Fund.  4. El Nino, development of monsoonThe El Nino impact is expected till June 2024, potentially impacting monsoon patterns and the cultivation of essential crops, thereby posing a notable threat to the rural economy.    ""The El Nino weather phenomenon, which brought dryness to large parts of Asia this year, is forecast to continue in the first half of 2024, putting at risk supplies of rice, wheat, palm oil and other farm products in some of the world's top agricultural exporters and importers,"" reported Reuters.    The monsoon significantly affects various aspects of India's economy like inflation, rural income, consumer demand, trade, and farming productivity.    Over half of India's population relies on agriculture and related fields for their livelihood. The agricultural sector, contributing approximately 18 per cent to the country's total output, heavily relies on the monsoon for its success.  5. Geopolitical developmentsGeopolitical factors significantly influence investors' risk tolerance by impacting economic stability, causing volatility in stock markets, and triggering fluctuations in currency values.    Apart from the above-mentioned factors, crude oil prices, the movement of the US dollar and bond yields, and government policies are among several other factors that will continue influencing market sentiment in 2024.    Also Read: Market Outlook: 6 key sectors investors should watch out for in 2024  What experts sayAnand Shah, Head PMS and AIF Investments, ICICI Prudential AMC2024 is an election year both in India and the US. The outcomes of these events may have a transient impact on the market. Next is the anticipated traction in domestic capex driven predominantly by the private sector. Furthermore, both the corporates and the banks have robust balance sheets to support private capital expenditure. And finally, the interest rate trend after inflation starts to cool off.  Tanvi Kanchan, Head - Corporate Strategy, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock BrokersOne of the key events to look at would be steady growth with the year divided into two halves – with general elections set in Q2 2024, the first half of the year to be driven by government spending and post-election we can expect investment growth to re-accelerate, lead by the private sector.    Rapid monetary tightening initiated in 2022 may have a significantly greater adverse effect on growth than is presently estimated. As a result of the inflationary surge that occurred in 2022, the major central banks might be considerably more reticent about reducing interest rates during the current cycle.    Recessions in the euro area and the United States continue to be distinct possibilities. These setbacks, in conjunction with the current overvalued state of the US equity market, indicate that a significant market correction in the United States is probable in 2024.  Kedar Kadam, Director - Listed Investments, Waterfield AdvisorsThe key factors to watch out for will be:    (i) Global macro and geopolitical developments, (ii) domestic inflation trajectory, especially food inflation, (iii) a slowdown in the pace of rural recovery, (iv) a narrow rate easing cycle, (v) a further decline in exports, (vi) fiscal balances.

India will most likely see General Elections in April-May. A stable government post-election is anticipated and would be favourably received by the domestic market. While an NDA victory might not result in a substantial market upsurge, its defeat could prompt a swift, short-term reaction. Nevertheless, the market is expected to eventually refocus on fundamental aspects and corporate earnings.   ""With recent big wins in MP, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan state elections, the likelihood of NDA coming to power again in 2024 has increased substantially. We don’t think the 2024 win will trigger any sharp rally in the market, it will just be business as usual. A loss though can cause an immediate negative reaction in the markets,"" said Ashutosh Tiwari, Managing Director and Head of Institutional Equities at Equirus.   ""Foundations laid by the current government in infrastructure, manufacturing, import substitution, etc., are going to fuel economic growth over the medium term and hence barring short-term reactions, we don’t see any risk of a steep correction in the markets,"" said Tiwari.

Budget 2024The Budget in February will be a Vote on Account ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. However, after the government is formed, the July Budget will be a key macro event for the market.    ""We expect the Budget 2024 to continue on its stated guide path of fiscal deficit targets. Focus on infrastructure development and measures to enhance Indian manufacturing competitiveness should continue unrelentingly in our view,"" said Sonam Udasi, Senior Fund Manager at Tata Mutual Fund.  4. El Nino, development of monsoonThe El Nino impact is expected till June 2024, potentially impacting monsoon patterns and the cultivation of essential crops, thereby posing a notable threat to the rural economy.    ""The El Nino weather phenomenon, which brought dryness to large parts of Asia this year, is forecast to continue in the first half of 2024, putting at risk supplies of rice, wheat, palm oil and other farm products in some of the world's top agricultural exporters and importers,"" reported Reuters.    The monsoon significantly affects various aspects of India's economy like inflation, rural income, consumer demand, trade, and farming productivity.    Over half of India's population relies on agriculture and related fields for their livelihood. The agricultural sector, contributing approximately 18 per cent to the country's total output, heavily relies on the monsoon for its success.  5.

Share of US treasury in RBI reserves shrink, gold sees an increase

",https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/share-of-us-treasury-in-rbi-reserves-shrink-gold-sees-an-increase-11703617584907.html,LiveMint,06:05 AM IST,"
MUMBAI
    : 
     
      The share of US treasury securities in Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) overall foreign exchange reserves shrank in the 12 months to September, while the share of gold holdings rose, data showed, with experts calling it an outcome of revaluation and a rise in holdings.
     
      The data on holdings of US treasury certificates is sourced from the December bulletin of markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which cites the US Department of the Treasury. The aggregate foreign exchange reserves data is from RBI. While India’s total holding of US treasury securities rose 7.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) to $229.1 billion in September, its share in RBI’s aggregate forex reserves shrank about one percentage point to 39%.
     
      On the other hand, the share of gold in total reserves rose to 7.45% at the end of September, as compared to 7.05% in September 2022. The total value of gold in reserves was at $43.7 billion at end-September and has since increased to $47.6 billion as on 15 December.
Mint reported on 19 November that RBI bought nine tonnes of gold in the September quarter, taking India’s official gold reserves to 806.7 tonnes as of September end and placing it at No. 10 in the pecking order, according to miner’s lobby World Gold Council (WGC). India purchased 16.2 tonnes of gold in 2023.
     
      “Central banks continue to buy gold as it has always been part of the reserves and global economic and geo-political context since 2019 imparts a strong case for gold,"" said Somasundaram PR, regional chief executive officer, India, World Gold Council.
     
      India has been diversifying its reserves since 2018, when it purchased 42.3 tonnes, 34.5 tonnes in 2019, 41.7 tonnes in 2020, 77.5 tonnes in 2021 and 33.3 tonnes in 2022. China’s central bank has been at the forefront of this diversification exercise, having purchased a whopping 204 tonnes of gold in 2023, from just 62.2 tonnes last year.
     
      “I would tend to think that this change that we have seen in the holdings of foreign exchange reserves is more as a part of RBI’s diversification strategy. There has been quite a bit of volatility in the last couple of years in terms of the assets held by various central banks, including the dollar which both strengthened and weakened over a period,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda.
     
      Sabnavis said gold prices have seen an upward movement, a phenomenon seen when global conditions are volatile. “I don’t think RBI or other central banks would look to maximize their gains as it is not an important consideration given that returns from these central government bonds are quite low. Instead, the idea is to hold on to reserves which have a stable value,"" he said.
     
      Gold prices rose 11.3% y-o-y to $1848.63 an ounce (31.10 grams) as of 29 September this year, according to data from Bloomberg . This is excluding the import duty of 15% charged by India for bringing gold into the country.
     
      Others expect the value of bonds held by the RBI to increase with global interest rates having peaked. In fact, the US Federal Reserve recently indicated three possible rate cuts in 2024, leading to the US 10-year benchmark bond yield falling below 4%, for the first time since August.
     
      “The base case is for the interest rate cycle to decline in 2024 and a soft landing for the US economy,"" said DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil. “With yields likely to come off, the value of the outstanding treasuries held will also rise.""Download the Mint app and read premium storiesLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

We reiterate our preference for defensive viz. pharma and FMCG for long trades and suggest picking selectively from others,'' added Mishra.    Technically, the sentiment remains optimistic as the index stays above critical moving averages. ‘’At 21,500, there could be significant immediate resistance. A decisive breakout beyond this level could potentially propel the index into a substantial rally. Until then, the index is expected to remain within the range of 21,300 and 21,500,'' said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.    On the outlook for Bank Nifty, Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said that the sentiment has again turned positive as the index moves back above 47,500. ‘’A small green bodied candle within the previous red candle indicates a potential bullish trend ahead. Support is established at 47,500 while resistance is observed at 48,000/48,250 on the higher side,'' added Shah.

F&O Ban ListA total of five stocks – Hindustan Copper, National Aluminium Company Limited, RBL Bank, Balrampur Chini Mills, and Delta Corp have been put under the ban for trade on Wednesday, December 27, under the futures and options (F&O) segment by the National Stock Exchange (NSE). No fresh positions are allowed for any of the F&O contracts in the particular stock when placed under the F&O ban period by the stock exchanges.  Day trading stocks for todayOn intraday stocks for today, stock market experts — Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager - Technical Research at Anand Rathi, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio —recommended six stocks to buy today.  Sumeet Bagadia's intraday stocks for today:1.Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Limited (GMDC): Buy GMDC at  ₹411.40 with a stop loss of  ₹401 at a target price of  ₹430.    GMDC is currently positioned at 411.40 levels, demonstrating technical strength and stability. The stock boasts a robust support zone at 401 levels, aligning closely with its 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). In the daily chart analysis, a minor resistance is noticeable around 420 levels. Upon surpassing this resistance, the stock is poised for an upward trajectory targeting 430 levels and beyond.     The stock's resilience is evident as it trades above short-term (20-Day), medium-term (50-Day), and long-term (200-Day) EMA levels, affirming its overall strength. The Momentum indicator, Relative Strength Index (RSI), has rebounded from lower levels, currently trading at 54, indicating renewed buying interest.     As the stock charts a path towards higher resistances, investors may find opportunities to capitalize on potential upward movements, with a cautious eye on the mentioned support levels and technical indicators for informed decision-making. Based on the above analysis we recommend buying GMDCLTD in cash at CMP of 411.40 for the target of 430 with a stop loss of 401.  2.Tata Chemicals: Buy Tata Chemicals at  ₹1,095 with a stop loss of  ₹1,068 at a target price of  ₹1,155.    Tata Chemicals daily chart analysis reveals a notable shift in market dynamics, transitioning from a period of minor declines and sideways consolidation to a promising upside bounce. The current trading session reflects a up move, potentially signalling an upside breakout from a narrow range momentum. This development aligns with a positive short-term trend, further reinforced by a surge in trading volume.    Key technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), underscore the stock's positive momentum. The RSI not only exhibits positive signals but the stock is also trading above crucial moving averages—specifically, the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). This convergence suggests sustained strength in Tata Chemicals price action.    Volume analysis further substantiates the credibility of the up move, with a pronounced increase accompanying the positive trend.

On the outlook for Nifty today, Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research, Religare Broking Ltd said, ‘’We have reached closer to the hurdle of 21,500 in Nifty and need support from the banking index to make a serious attempt for trend resumption else profit taking would resume.''   ‘’Amid all, traders should avoid aggressive trades in the index and stay focused on identifying opportunities on stock-specific front. We reiterate our preference for defensive viz. pharma and FMCG for long trades and suggest picking selectively from others,'' added Mishra.   Technically, the sentiment remains optimistic as the index stays above critical moving averages. ‘’At 21,500, there could be significant immediate resistance. A decisive breakout beyond this level could potentially propel the index into a substantial rally. Until then, the index is expected to remain within the range of 21,300 and 21,500,'' said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.   On the outlook for Bank Nifty, Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said that the sentiment has again turned positive as the index moves back above 47,500. ‘’A small green bodied candle within the previous red candle indicates a potential bullish trend ahead. Support is established at 47,500 while resistance is observed at 48,000/48,250 on the higher side,'' added Shah.

Global CuesIn Asian markets, Seoul and Tokyo settled with gains while Shanghai ended lower. Markets in Hong Kong were closed. US and European markets were closed on Monday. European markets remained closed on Tuesday for Boxing Day.    Oil jumped over two per cent on in the previous session to the highest in almost a month, supported by Middle East strife and investor optimism that the US Federal Reserve would soon start cutting interest rates, boosting global economic growth and fuel demand.    The rally - in thin trade with some markets closed for public holidays, added to last week's gains of about three per cent after Houthi attacks on ships disrupted global shipping and trade while the Israel-Hamas conflict shows no sign of easing.    Brent crude futures were up by $1.79, or 2.3 per cent, at $80.86 a barrel and earlier reached $81.23, the highest since December 1. US West Texas Intermediate crude rose by $1.89, or 2.6 per cent, to $75.45, according to news agency Reuters.

Additionally, shares of Aditya Birla Capital Ltd will also be in focus as the financial services arm of Aditya Birla Group said on Tuesday that it is infusing  ₹850 crore and  ₹50 crore in its subsidiaries, Aditya Birla Finance Ltd and Aditya Birla Capital Digital Ltd respectively on a rights basis.

Day trading stocks for todayOn intraday stocks for today, stock market experts — Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager - Technical Research at Anand Rathi, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio —recommended six stocks to buy today.  Sumeet Bagadia's intraday stocks for today:1.Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Limited (GMDC): Buy GMDC at  ₹411.40 with a stop loss of  ₹401 at a target price of  ₹430.    GMDC is currently positioned at 411.40 levels, demonstrating technical strength and stability. The stock boasts a robust support zone at 401 levels, aligning closely with its 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). In the daily chart analysis, a minor resistance is noticeable around 420 levels. Upon surpassing this resistance, the stock is poised for an upward trajectory targeting 430 levels and beyond.     The stock's resilience is evident as it trades above short-term (20-Day), medium-term (50-Day), and long-term (200-Day) EMA levels, affirming its overall strength. The Momentum indicator, Relative Strength Index (RSI), has rebounded from lower levels, currently trading at 54, indicating renewed buying interest.     As the stock charts a path towards higher resistances, investors may find opportunities to capitalize on potential upward movements, with a cautious eye on the mentioned support levels and technical indicators for informed decision-making. Based on the above analysis we recommend buying GMDCLTD in cash at CMP of 411.40 for the target of 430 with a stop loss of 401.  2.Tata Chemicals: Buy Tata Chemicals at  ₹1,095 with a stop loss of  ₹1,068 at a target price of  ₹1,155.

In Asian markets, Seoul and Tokyo settled with gains while Shanghai ended lower. Markets in Hong Kong were closed. US and European markets were closed on Monday. European markets remained closed on Tuesday for Boxing Day.   Oil jumped over two per cent on in the previous session to the highest in almost a month, supported by Middle East strife and investor optimism that the US Federal Reserve would soon start cutting interest rates, boosting global economic growth and fuel demand.   The rally - in thin trade with some markets closed for public holidays, added to last week's gains of about three per cent after Houthi attacks on ships disrupted global shipping and trade while the Israel-Hamas conflict shows no sign of easing.   Brent crude futures were up by $1.79, or 2.3 per cent, at $80.86 a barrel and earlier reached $81.23, the highest since December 1. US West Texas Intermediate crude rose by $1.89, or 2.6 per cent, to $75.45, according to news agency Reuters. Stocks to watch todayShares of Axis Bank and Zee Learn will be in focus during today's session after Axis Bank approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday with a plea seeking insolvency proceeding against Zee Learn.    Additionally, shares of Aditya Birla Capital Ltd will also be in focus as the financial services arm of Aditya Birla Group said on Tuesday that it is infusing  ₹850 crore and  ₹50 crore in its subsidiaries, Aditya Birla Finance Ltd and Aditya Birla Capital Digital Ltd respectively on a rights basis.  F&O Ban ListA total of five stocks – Hindustan Copper, National Aluminium Company Limited, RBL Bank, Balrampur Chini Mills, and Delta Corp have been put under the ban for trade on Wednesday, December 27, under the futures and options (F&O) segment by the National Stock Exchange (NSE). No fresh positions are allowed for any of the F&O contracts in the particular stock when placed under the F&O ban period by the stock exchanges.  Day trading stocks for todayOn intraday stocks for today, stock market experts — Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager - Technical Research at Anand Rathi, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio —recommended six stocks to buy today.  Sumeet Bagadia's intraday stocks for today:1.Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Limited (GMDC): Buy GMDC at  ₹411.40 with a stop loss of  ₹401 at a target price of  ₹430.    GMDC is currently positioned at 411.40 levels, demonstrating technical strength and stability. The stock boasts a robust support zone at 401 levels, aligning closely with its 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). In the daily chart analysis, a minor resistance is noticeable around 420 levels. Upon surpassing this resistance, the stock is poised for an upward trajectory targeting 430 levels and beyond.     The stock's resilience is evident as it trades above short-term (20-Day), medium-term (50-Day), and long-term (200-Day) EMA levels, affirming its overall strength. The Momentum indicator, Relative Strength Index (RSI), has rebounded from lower levels, currently trading at 54, indicating renewed buying interest.     As the stock charts a path towards higher resistances, investors may find opportunities to capitalize on potential upward movements, with a cautious eye on the mentioned support levels and technical indicators for informed decision-making. Based on the above analysis we recommend buying GMDCLTD in cash at CMP of 411.40 for the target of 430 with a stop loss of 401.  2.Tata Chemicals: Buy Tata Chemicals at  ₹1,095 with a stop loss of  ₹1,068 at a target price of  ₹1,155.    Tata Chemicals daily chart analysis reveals a notable shift in market dynamics, transitioning from a period of minor declines and sideways consolidation to a promising upside bounce. The current trading session reflects a up move, potentially signalling an upside breakout from a narrow range momentum. This development aligns with a positive short-term trend, further reinforced by a surge in trading volume.    Key technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), underscore the stock's positive momentum. The RSI not only exhibits positive signals but the stock is also trading above crucial moving averages—specifically, the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). This convergence suggests sustained strength in Tata Chemicals price action.    Volume analysis further substantiates the credibility of the up move, with a pronounced increase accompanying the positive trend. The comprehensive evaluation of Tata Chemicals daily chart implies the existence of a broader bullish pattern in the stock price.     This, in turn, presents a compelling long trading opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on the anticipated upward trajectory.

Contrasting fortunes for new listings

",https://www.livemint.com/market/ipo/contrasting-fortunes-for-new-listings-11703617231163.html,LiveMint,12:35 AM IST," MUMBAI :      The investor reception to three issues that listed on Tuesday was mixed; while Motisons Jewellers Ltd made a stellar debut, Suraj Estates Ltd and Muthoot Microfin elicited a tepid response.   Motisons Jewellers, a diamond and gold jewellery retailer, listed at  ₹109 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE)—a staggering 98.18% premium to its issue price of  ₹55.   It continued to climb, reaching an intraday high of  ₹109.8, before settling at  ₹103.55 on the NSE. The overwhelming demand for Motisons Jewellers shares showed up in an oversubscription of 159.6 times.   The retail portion was bid 122 times.   In contrast, Muthoot Microfin, a microfinance lender, stumbled on its debut day.   Its shares listed at  ₹275.30 on the NSE—a disappointing 5.39% discount to the issue price of  ₹291.   It briefly touched an intraday high of  ₹281 before settling at  ₹266.15, down 8.45% on the NSE. This muted response came as a surprise considering the company’s robust subscription of 11.5 times. However, the retail portion was bid 7.6 times   Analysts attribute this disparity to year-end profit booking, with investors looking to secure gains before entering the new year.   “There appears to be a trend of profit booking among many IPOs, with investors opting to secure their gains as we enter the new year. The focus seems to be more on profit realization rather than fresh buying in these IPOs,"" said Kranthi Bathini, director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities Pvt. Ltd.   Suraj Estate Developers Ltd, a real estate developer, also faced investor skepticism on its debut.   Its shares listed at  ₹340 on the NSE, marking a 5.55% decline compared to the issue price of  ₹360. It reached an intraday high of  ₹354.45 before settling at  ₹334.50, a discount of 7% to the issue price.   While the issue was subscribed 15.6 times, investors copped out at listing.Milestone Alert!

          America may soon be spending more on debt service than defence
        
",https://www.livemint.com/economy/america-may-soon-be-spending-more-on-debt-service-than-defence-11703657469168.html,LiveMint,11:59 AM IST,"
     
      THE BOND market is sending a hopeful message about the strength of the American economy—and, perhaps, raising alarm about America’s unsustainable finances. The news is coming via surging rates on long-term bonds. When the Federal Reserve started raising its benchmark federal-funds rate in March 2022, long-term interest rates rose with it. This continued fairly steadily until the end of last year, when rates flattened out. Then in May, to the surprise of many investors, long-term rates began climbing once more. They show no sign of slowing. On October 11th the yield on ten-year Treasury bonds hit 4.7%, near a 16-year high.
     
      Because bond prices and yields are inversely related, this is bad for bond investors, who are suffering “the greatest bond bear market of all time"", according to Bank of America. But it is also bad for Uncle Sam. When bond yields rise, the cost of financing America’s debt—now $26trn and growing—also goes up. In the fiscal year ending on September 30th 2023, interest payments on America’s debt totalled some $660bn, up from $475bn the previous year. As recently as May 2022 the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a non-partisan number-cruncher, had forecast such costs would be $442bn, or 33% lower.
     
      This would not be such a problem if America were putting its fiscal house in order. But estimates released on October 10th by the CBO show that the federal deficit ballooned to $2trn (7.6% of GDP) in the year to September 30th, up from $900bn (3.5%) the previous year. If interest rates and deficits do not come down, fiscal hawks warn, the cost of servicing America’s debt could rocket, crowding out other spending. The CBO estimates that, even assuming a drop in rates, interest costs by 2028 will reach $1trn, or 3.1% of projected GDP—more than will be spent on defence.
     
      Such figures should frighten policymakers in Washington. Even on a benign reading of the reason why interest rates have resumed rising—that the chances of imminent recession have fallen, causing the Fed to keep its benchmark higher for longer—interest payments as a share of GDP are likely to keep rising because of the widening deficit, despite the better prospects for growth. And on a less benign reading—that rising rates reflect fear about the scale of issuance of Treasury debt issuance and lack of appetite for such securities—there is all the more reason to worry.
     
      Whatever the reason, equity investors see a silver lining. On October 9th, in remarks to the National Association for Business Economics, a trade association, Lorie Logan, president of the Dallas Fed, said that about half of the increase in long-term rates since July reflects a rise in the “term premium"", the extra return that investors demand to compensate them for locking up their money for longer periods. If long-term interest rates remain high, Ms Logan explained, further Fed tightening later this year may not be necessary. Shares promptly jumped. The stock market’s concerns about America’s fiscal health, at least, will wait for another day.

          In Turkey, Erdogan’s charges of Western hypocrisy stick
        
",https://www.livemint.com/politics/in-turkey-erdogan-s-charges-of-western-hypocrisy-stick-11703651748912.html,LiveMint,10:12 AM IST,"
     
      NOTHING makes Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s day like a chance to claim the moral high ground, cast himself as the leader of the Muslim world, and stick it to the West. For nearly three months, the war in Gaza has allowed Turkey’s president to do just that. At a recent conference, Mr Erdogan was in his element, taking swings at Israel for bombing northern Gaza into the ground, and at Western duplicity. “A journalist is killed each day,"" he said, referring to the 68 media workers killed in Gaza since the start of Israel’s bombing campaign. “But none of the institutions who preach to us about press freedom for years says even a single word.""
     
      That of course is an exaggeration. Human-rights watchdogs have been slamming Israel for the killings of Palestinian civilians and journalists since the start of the war. But in Turkey, the charges Mr Erdogan now levels against Western countries at nearly every public appearance tend to stick. With the Gazan authorities saying that the death toll from Israel’s bombardment has passed 20,000, criticism of Western policy and accusations of double standards in Turkey are reaching new heights. Speak not just with officials in Ankara, but with opposition politicians, dissidents, and ordinary Turks, and you will hear that Western governments that sanctioned Turkey for using disproportionate force in northern Syria ought to, but refuse to, sanction Israel for doing much worse in Gaza; that those that criticise Turkey for banning anti-government protests lose the moral right to do so when they ban pro-Palestinian marches at home; and so on.
     
      Similar sentiments have been widespread in many parts of the global south, even before Gaza. But Turkey is a Muslim country whose human-rights record invites considerably more scrutiny than most, because of its membership of NATO and its aspirations to join the EU; its relationship with the West is immensely important. Hence accusations of Western hypocrisy leave a bigger mark than in most other parts of the world. They play into Mr Erdogan’s hands, reinforcing his argument that Turkey should have no patience for Western values and should chart its own course. They weaken his democratically-minded opponents. And they sap outside attempts to promote human rights.
     
      Turkey’s relations with Europe and America were already strained. The war in Gaza has compounded the damage. Mr Erdogan continues to defend Hamas, unlike Western leaders, who want nothing to do with militants responsible for the gruesome murder of 1,200 Israelis, or even many Arab strongmen, who heap opprobrium on Israel but quietly hope that the war will spell the end of the group. Mr Erdogan says Hamas are not terrorists, but “mujahideen"", or holy warriors. The war means that his government’s longstanding relationship with the group has been put under the microscope. The group’s exiled leaders, including those who are based in Turkey, claim to have been unaware of preparations for the attack on October 7th. Evidence to the contrary could expose Turkey to charges of negligence at best, and complicity at worst.
     
      Mr Erdogan’s defence of Hamas has upended Turkey’s fledgling rapprochement with Israel, and cost him any chance of a photo-op with Joe Biden in the near future. Combined with his decision to delay Sweden’s accession to NATO, it may also force America’s Congress to shelve a planned sale of F-16 warplanes to Turkey. Turkish approval is required for Sweden to join the alliance; its outrage over America’s handling of the war in Gaza has added to the risk its parliament may instead scuttle the membership bid entirely.
     
      But the long-term implications are just as serious. Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza may make it harder for Western countries to take Turkey to task for attacking civilian infrastructure in Syria, where Turkish troops are fighting Kurdish insurgents. Appeals for Turkey to condemn Russian war crimes in Ukraine risk falling flat when America brushes aside evidence of Israeli ones in Gaza. The perception of Western double standards has already compromised the ability of Europe and America to discuss norms with Turkey, as opposed to just interests. “It was hard enough before Gaza to talk about human rights because Erdogan is so intolerant of outside criticism,"" says one Western diplomat. “Now it will be exponentially more so.""
     
      Gaza does not matter to Turkey the same way that it matters to much of the Arab world. With the exception of a vocal religious minority, who consider the conflict their own, most Turks do not identify with the Palestinians (unlike most Arabs). But the vast majority, including the secular opposition, do sympathise with them. According to one recent poll, 76% of Turks side with the Palestinians, compared with only 5% who side with Israel.
     
      But the conflict also matters to the dwindling number of Turks who see their country as part of the Western order. The West’s stock in Turkey is waning, because its policies are increasingly at odds with Turkey’s, but also because many Turks feel that Western norms and values disintegrate on impact with places like Gaza. In a poll published only days before the October 7th massacre, a mere 12% of Turks identified America as a friendly country, compared with 77% who saw it as an enemy. Support for America and most European countries is certain to be even lower today.
     
      The outside world’s inability to stop the fighting in Gaza not only offers Mr Erdogan the moral high ground he craves, but makes him stronger and even less accountable for his own abuses of power, according to Yigit Aksakoglu, an exiled Turkish civil society activist. “This is a race to the bottom,"" he says. Before he was acquitted, Mr Aksakoglu had spent seven months in prison on bogus terror charges for his alleged involvement in protests against Mr Erdogan’s government. “One of the biggest hypocrites of our time is accusing Western leaders of hypocrisy,"" he says. But most Turks, including Mr Aksakoglu, agree that these days the hypocrite may have a point. “Erdogan’s right,"" he says. “And for the West this is a shame.""

",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tencent-netease-stocks-rebound-after-chinese-regulator-softens-crackdown-on-online-gaming-11703653529491.html,LiveMint,11:00 AM IST,"      China's Tencent Holdings saw its shares stage a recovery on December 27, the first day of trade, after authorities vowed to make improvements to proposed rules that had sent stocks in video game companies into sharp corrections.   Online gaming contributes over one-fifth of revenue for Tencent - a tech behemoth. The shares of Tencent jumped over 5 per cent in morning trade on December 27, after a 12 per cent tumble on December 22. Hong Kong markets were closed on December 25 and December 26 for public holidays.    Rival NetEase shot up 10 per cent compared with a 25 per cent plunge on December 22, also helped by local media reports since December 25 that it is again in talks to partner with World of Warcraft-maker Blizzard. The two companies abruptly parted ways a year ago.   Also Read | China's new rules to reduce spending on video games create panic among investors, wipes off $80 billion   Draft rules that curb spending and use rewards that encourage playing video games were published on December 22, raising concerns that regulators were once again cracking down heavily on the sector.   Contradicting its previous stance, China's video game regulator - the National Press and Publication Administration, came up with a more conciliatory tone, saying it would improve the rules by ""earnestly studying"" public views. The development came soon after the dramatic tumbling of gaming stocks. It then approved new licenses for 105 domestic online games for December - more than the average month.   ""We believe these fire-quenching measures may help to slightly ease market concerns, but they are not enough to remove the overhang caused by the draft regulation,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a note to clients, according to a report by Reuters.   The industry has just started to regain its growth this year following the end of an extended clampdown in 2021 and 2022.   Earlier this month, Blizzard China, the company's Chinese subsidiary, published a post, saying that it is in talks with publishing partners in China to continue the game's service in the country.   The proposed regulations, currently open for public feedback until January 24, aim to prohibit online games from rewarding players for daily logins, initial in-game spending, or consecutive spending. These reward mechanisms are commonly employed in online games.   While the announcement caught the industry and investors by surprise, it aligns with the ongoing efforts of Chinese authorities to address issues such as myopia, internet addiction, and gaming addiction among the youth. In 2021, the government implemented a curfew for minor video game players, and in August, the cyberspace regulator in China recommended limiting smartphone usage to two hours a day for individuals under 18.   Mainland China's gaming shares, predominantly representing smaller players in the industry, experienced modest gains. On Wednesday, the Anime Comic Game Index saw a marginal increase of 0.4%, rebounding from a 15% decline over the previous three sessions.   Several companies have recently announced share buybacks, interpreted as efforts to reassure investors. However, the impact of boosting share prices has been limited, at best.

Wipro sues former CFO Jatin Dalal; what we know so far

",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/wipro-sues-former-ceo-jatin-dalal-what-we-know-so-far-11703648873436.html,LiveMint,09:36 AM IST,"      IT major Wipro has initiated legal proceedings against its former CFO, Jatin Dalal, in a civil court in Bengaluru. In response, Dalal has filed an application requesting the court to refer the matter to arbitration. While the specific grounds for the lawsuit remain unclear, arguments from both parties have been presented, and the next hearing is scheduled for January 3, according to a report by Times of India.   At that time, the court will decide whether the matter should proceed to arbitration. Arbitration, an alternative dispute resolution method using an arbitrator instead of a judicial court, may be employed if the employment contract stipulates it, the report added. Cognizant Technology Solutions named the former Wipro chief financial officer as its CFO in September, a week after his resignation from the Indian information technology (IT) major, as reported by Mint earlier.   He joined Wipro in 2002 and took over as the company’s CFO in 2015. His last day is 30 November. Wipro appointed Aparna Iyer as his successor.   In early December, Dalal filed an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996, granting the judicial authority the power to direct parties to arbitration, the TOI report added. Also read  | Cognizant appoints former Wipro finance chief Jatin Dalal as CFO   Dalal is the second high profile hire by Cognizant in the past twelve months, after it named former Infosys President Ravi Kumar S as its CEO in January.   Wipro has also lodged a complaint against its former senior vice-president (SVP) and head of healthcare and medical devices for the Americas, Mohd Haque. The complaint alleges that Haque violated non-compete covenants by joining Cognizant as the SVP and business unit head for life sciences. Wipro further accuses Haque of sharing confidential files from his personal Gmail account, breaching his employment contract, the report further added.    Milestone Alert!

M&M accelerates ‘Born EV’ plans, to expedite launches

",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/mm-accelerates-born-ev-plans-to-expedite-launches-11703614267889.html,LiveMint,06:10 AM IST,"
     
      Homegrown automaker Mahindra & Mahindra is expediting its plans to launch its ground-up electric vehicles, with four brand-new electric sport utility vehicles (SUVs) expected to be launched by the first quarter of calendar year 2025, persons in the know told Mint on condition of anonymity.
     
      The company is looking to advance its EV launch plans as it is eager to kick-off its new electric vehicle portfolio in the market, given the XUV400, an electrified version of its internal combustion-engine (ICE) product XUV300 is the only electric SUV from the automaker on offer at present and gives it limited access to the market for EVs in India, dominated by rivals like Tata Motors and MG Motor India.
     
      Mahindra had previously stated that the XUV.e8 will be the first EV it will launch in the market in December 2024, followed by the e9 in April 2025 and BE.05 in October 2025. However, according to the company’s new plans, the XUV.e9 (codenamed the M310), the more coupe-like, premium counterpart of the XUV.e8 will make it to the market first, with a reveal expected on Independence Day (15 August) next year, with bookings likely to open around September-October shortly after, and deliveries slated from January 2025. The Rall-E, the e9 and Mahindra’s new EV brand, BE.05, are all expected to debut in the months between January and April 2025, in a departure from the company’s earlier plans to stagger its launches.
     
      The company will leverage the fact that all of its ‘Born EVs’ will be built on a new, common platform INGLO to bring them to market at speed, although deliveries of some are only likely to begin after Q1 of 2025 due to supply chain delays.
     
      Mahindra is positioning its electric SUVs as premium, luxury offerings in the market, with focus on segment-first features, like a 36-inch immersive-display, panoramic sunroof, immersive sound and light experiences to market to upwardly-mobile customers who seek feature-rich offerings at competitive prices.
     
      Mahindra & Mahindra declined to comment on Mint’s query.
     
      The company is testing the M310 at its SUV proving track in Chennai, involving suppliers early in the testing and feedback process. The company has hired management consulting firm McKinsey to implement feedback from top executives of the company’s top suppliers, who are being actively called to drive the products and give feedback on drivability, comfort, features and performance, into the design process, a first-of-its kind undertaking by an automotive OEM in the country, the people quoted earlier said.
     
      “The first of the products (the XUV. e9) is at a very advanced level of readiness and testing. They’re not positioning the vehicles as BEVs, but are instead looking to market them as a luxury line of vehicles. The good thing is they’re involving suppliers early to improve the vehicle and identify early fails to a point that before it goes to the customer’s hands, there should be few complaints as this is a new proposition for them to sell and for the customers to accept,"" a supplier said on condition of anonymity.
     
      In an earlier interaction, Shailesh Chandra, CEO and MD of Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle business, said while customers of the first-generation of EVs were early adopters and were accommodating of less-than-perfect new technologies, the second wave of customer adoption “will not accept any compromises"".
     
      “Mahindra by now has the pulse of its customers and will price the product competitively. Its XUV700 is a case in point - none of the company’s recent launches have been perceived as over-priced"", a second industry stakeholder told Mint.
     
      “Mahindra’s timelines, however, are very bullish and it can take the company some time to kick things off - but their target is stringent and they want to play aggressively in EVs now without much delay as they cannot afford to remain dependent on diesel for long"", he added.
     
      Over the next five years, Mahindra expects up to 30% of all the SUVs it sells in India to be EVs. It also knows many of these are unlikely to be existing Mahindra customers. Enter, BE. This brand new EV-only identity, coexisting alongside XUV brands that the company’s tech-savvy customers are already familiar with, is the dual strategy M&M will follow till 2027. Born EVs are vehicles manufactured on a pure EV platform. While rival Tata Motors has an early lead in the electric vehicle market, M&M will be the first automaker in India to carve out multiple models and brands on a single EV platform. Mahindra says its line-up of five EVs, developed on the born electric INGLO platform, will be its most powerful vehicles yet.
     
      Tata Motors, so far the nearly unrivalled leader in EVs, commands nearly 70% of the market and has plans to launch its own pure electric EV Avinya about the same time, as well as EV SUVs such as the Harrier, Curvv and Sierra, which will give Mahindra a tough fight.
     
      In August, Singapore’s Temasek said it will invest  ₹1,200 crore in Mahindra’s electric vehicle subsidiary Mahindra Electric Automobile Ltd (MEAL), joining British International Investments (BII) as an investor in MEAL. The investment values the automaker’s EV subsidiary at  ₹80,580 crore.Download the Mint app and read premium storiesLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Entire Dish TV board ousted in shareholder coup

",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/entire-dish-tv-board-ousted-in-shareholder-coup-11703613018788.html,LiveMint,08:53 AM IST,"
MUMBAI
    : 
     
       
     
      Shareholders of Dish TV India Ltd rejected the candidature of its remaining four independent directors, a rare instance at a listed company that found itself without a functional board for a brief while.
     
      Over 71% of shareholders voted against appointing Rajesh Sahni, Virender Tagra, Aanchal David and Shankar Aggarwal at Friday’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM), the country’s third-largest satellite television provider said in a stock exchange disclosure.
     
      Subsequently, Dish TV appointed Sanjay Khanna as non-executive independent director and Ravi Bhushan Puri as executive director. Both were named by the board on 18 December, likely in anticipation of an upset at the upcoming EGM.
     
      Khanna and Puri were inducted before approval from the ministry of information and broadcasting, which is mandatory for directors of all television broadcasters. However, Dish TV managed to induct the two as its board strength fell below the statutory minimum requirement of three members.
     
      With Friday’s action, a total of 13 directors have been booted out from Dish TV by shareholders since September 2021, when Yes Bank, the then-largest investor, raised the banner of revolt.
     
      The list of ousted directors includes Dish TV managing director Jawahar Goel, younger brother of Subhash Chandra, whose candidature was rejected in September last year.
     
      Goel, who owns 4.04% of Dish TV, is facing displeasure from shareholders unhappy with what they believe is poor corporate governance. Shareholders have raised concerns around the company’s investments in its OTT (over-the-top) platform Watcho and the composition of the board, besides other issues.
     
      Dish TV has denied any wrongdoing.
     
      “Unless shareholders and the promoters sit across a table and come to an agreement on directors, this churn will continue,"" a senior advisor at a proxy advisory firm said on the condition of anonymity.
     
      The tussle traces its roots to September 2021 when Yes Bank, then its biggest shareholder, sought to reconstitute Dish TV’s board. Essel Group founder Chandra had borrowed more than  ₹5,000 crore from the private lender, but his inability to repay the loans prompted the bank to invoke the shares of Dish TV that were pledged as collateral.
     
      In December 2022, Yes Bank transferred its shares to JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Co., which became the largest shareholder with a 24.19% stake in the company.
     
      Proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) had recommended voting against the appointments, while noting that these appointments were in line with statutory requirements. It had recommended voting against them on the grounds that the company has in the past failed to address concerns raised by its shareholders, including their request to call an EGM.
     
      Queries sent to Dish TV on the development remained unanswered.
     
      Over the last 30 months, at least two requests by the shareholders to convene an EGM to remove some directors and appoint a fresh set of independent directors were rejected by the company on various technical grounds.
     
      The company, meanwhile, had failed to induct shareholder-nominated directors despite receiving necessary government approvals, Mint reported in March.Download the Mint app and read premium storiesLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

The headlights and front bumper have been redesigned, adding a modern touch. The rear of the GLS gets new LED tail-lamps, contributing to its distinct identity. The SUV will also come with new 20-inch wheels in Himalayas Grey for that added touch of sophistication.Inside the car, the GLS is stepping up its game with a revamped MBUX infotainment system. This system, positioned in the centre and the driver’s instrument cluster, now offers three display modes – Classic, Sporty, and Discreet. The interior will boast new upholstery options, Catalana Brown and Bahia Brown, elevating the luxury feel.

Most of the patients are currently in home isolation, they added.NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul had said last week that the new variant was being closely investigated but he stressed on the need for states to ramp up testing and strengthen their surveillance systems.Even though the number of cases is rising and the JN.1 sub-variant has been detected in the country, there is no cause of immediate concern as 92 per cent of those infected are opting for home-based treatment, indicating a mild illness, officials have said.There is also no increase in hospitalisation rates and COVID-19 is an incidental finding in those hospitalised due to other medical conditions, they said.Union Health Secretary Sudhansh Pant last week had written to states and Union territories calling for requisite public health measures to be put in place and underlined the critical COVID-19 control and management strategies considering the ongoing festive season.States have been urged to ensure effective compliance of operational guidelines for revised surveillance strategy for COVID-19 shared by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.They have asked to monitor and report district-wise cases of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) in all health facilities regularly for early detection of rising trend of cases.India saw a single-day rise of 529 cases of COVID-19, while the number of active cases of the infection was recorded at 4,093, the health ministry said on Wednesday.Three new fatalities -- two from Karnataka and one from Gujarat were reported in the last 24 hours, according to the ministry's data updated at 8 am.The JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), emerged in August 2023 in Luxembourg and is descendant of the BA.2.86 lineage (Pirola) of SARS COV2.

Their one-year forward target prices have been revised to Rs 11,500, Rs 2,900, and Rs 1,250, respectively, indicating potential upsides of 15 percent, 32 percent, and 28 percent. It retained the 'buy' tag on Shree Cements but raised the target price to Rs 33,400 from Rs 27,800.Shares of Ultratech Cement jumped to a fresh 52-week high of Rs 10,379.70 and gained nearly 3 percent, while Dalmia Bharat rose nearly 4 percent and Ramco Cement 3 percent. Shree Cement erased its morning gains and traded marginally lower around mid-day.India's cement industry showed robust volume growth of 17 percent year-on-year in the first half of FY24. The momentum is expected to persist in the second half, anticipating an 11 percent increase in sales volumes from the first half and a 13 percent year-on-year surge, Nomura said. It has revised its industry volume growth estimate to 12 percent for FY24, up from 8 percent earlier.""For FY25, cement demand, in our view, is likely to moderate as infrastructure project launches typically slow down in the country in a general election year. However, the demand should remain higher than the past 10-year CAGR of 4 percent, largely due to the central government’s continued thrust on infrastructure, stable demand from rural and affordable housing and a pickup in urban housing. We expect a 5 percent CAGR in cement demand over FY24-26, but weak rural demand poses a downside risk,"" Nomura said in its note.Nomura highlighted strong volume growth and reduced fuel costs in FY24. Pet coke and thermal coal prices for FY24 dropped 35 percent and 45 percent year-to-date. Despite recent increases, spot prices remain significantly lower than the FY23 highs. Cement spreads have increased by Rs 300 per tonne in 3QFY24, based on a 90-day lagged fuel cost. Nomura expects an average unitary EBITDA improvement of Rs 200-250 per tonne in 3QFY24.Even if fuel costs rise, the full impact will be seen from 2QFY25F. Nomura predicts an average unitary EBITDA expansion of Rs 150-200 per tonne in FY25 due to robust volume momentum, improved pricing discipline, and relatively lower costs.Prakash Diwan notes that larger cement players (Ultratech Cement, ACC, Ambuja, and Dalmia Bharat) are gaining pricing power due to reduced raw material costs like coking coal and transportation. Favourable margins have been sustained due to lower crude oil prices over the past six months, except for recent disruptions in the Red Sea.Reports, like one from Nomura, have boosted enthusiasm in the sector, causing a surge in related cement stocks. With the housing sector contributing to 42 percent of India's cement production and growing infrastructure projects, existing capacities are expected to be better utilised, signaling positive prospects for the industry, he added.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The authority has now released their first set of results testing the new facelifted Tata Safari and Tata Harrier awarding both SUVs five stars. Just about a month ago, the cars were also tested under the Global New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) standards and won five stars for both adult occupant safety as well as for child occupant protection.Scoring between both the Global NCAP and the Bharat NCAP are largely similar. While on the Global NCAP crash tests, the Safari and Harrier scored 33.05 points out of a maximum of 34 in adult occupant safety, on the B-NCAP, the SUVs scored 30.08 out of a maximum of 32 points. According to the report, the crash test dummies displayed good protection for the head, knees and feet of both passenger and driver.While the passenger dummy also displayed good protection for the tibia and chest, the driver’s chest displayed adequate protection for the right tibia and marginal protection for the chest. In the side movable deformable barrier test as well as the side pole impact test, the dummies displayed good protection overall.The difference between the GNCAP and BNCAP frontal crash test and side test is fairly minor. However, the GNCAP side pole impact test displayed adequate protection for the abdomen and only marginal protection to the chest.On the child occupant protection front, the Safari and Harrier scored a total of 44.54 points out of a maximum of 49 which again, amounts to a 5-star rating just like the GNCAP score.The Tata Harrier and Tata Safari, are both powered by the same 2.0-litre Kryotec engine. This four-cylinder powertrain is capable of producing a maximum of 170 hp of power and 350 Nm of peak torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual shifter and a 6-speed torque convertor automatic. As far as the safety features go, both cars get six airbags as standard across the range with a seventh knee airbag on the higher trim levels. Other safety features include emergency call/breakdown button, 360-degree camera, ABS, ESC, ISOFIX child seat anchors, etc. The higher trims of both SUVs also get Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) technology allowing for added safety such as autonomous emergency braking, forward collision warning, traffic sign recognition, blind spot detection and lane departure warning, among others.Now, this has only been the first test conducted by Bharat NCAP. The crash test authority will be testing more Indian cars in the coming days and months and we can expect to see their results being published on the official website in the near future.

Though the finances and scholarship were arranged by the university, he encountered a nightmarish ordeal when it came to booking his flight.Qureshi, hesitant to book online, asked his brother-in-law to make the reservation. However, the joyous anticipation of his departure turned into a nightmare when, at the airport, he discovered that his ticket was not confirmed, and a transit visa through France was required.Panic set in as he frantically sought a solution. “The security was not allowing me to go out and discuss with my family. Then a relative arranged a mobile number at the supposed visa office in India. I doubted at first but didn’t want to let go of the chance to travel,” he told Moneycontrol.The person on the other side of the phone promised to arrange a visa within 10 minutes with a one-time fee of Rs 25,000. The process began by downloading the AnyDesk app on Qureshi’s phone before asking for bank details.ALSO READ | Indian students still prefer to study in the UK despite expensive poundWhile talking to the “visa person”, the money started to get debited in three simultaneous transactions. Before Qureshi got alarmed and disconnected the AnyDesk app and call, he had already lost Rs 90,000.Dejected, Qureshi decided to cancel his travel plans, reporting the incident to the police.Though Qureshi successfully embarked on his trip to the UK later, it serves as a cautionary tale of the perils that unsuspecting students may face in the pursuit of higher education abroad.Rising scamsWith the UK government’s recent decision to tighten immigration rules, cases of students falling to unique scams are on the surge, say overseas education consultants.NatWest’s 2023 Student Living Index revealed a third of the students in UK universities have been targeted by criminals in 2022. The top location for student scams was Bournemouth, with 44 percent of the students becoming a target. Edinburgh and Oxford were next in the rankings, with 41 percent of students falling victims. The report doesn't have country-wise figures.ALSO READ | India’s first foreign university to offer blended courses, recruit faculty from beyond IITsLiving under fear amidst sweeping changes, students receive calls from scammers citing policy changes, which were never notified by the government.“The main scam we hear about is students receiving calls from somebody impersonating as an immigration officer. They would usually say something is missing in their immigration history or some documents and ‘there's a penalty which has to be attached or else we are coming to pick you up’,” said Suneet Singh Kochar, CEO of study abroad consultancy Fateh Education.Under panic, students offer to pay the ‘penalty’, which can range from 600 to 1,000 euros.The genuineness of the call is ensured through phone numbers which are spoofed to look official and a replica of government embassies.ALSO READ | 2023 Recap: Here are major immigration policy changes in Canada, UK, Australia and USThe scams even reached the domain of identity cards, with some students falling victim to counterfeit identification schemes, pitched as limited cards for overseas students launched by universities to offer students some relief in the changing immigration policies.Priya Deshpande (name changed on request), an English Literature student at the University of York, shared her ordeal of obtaining a fake ID card that promised unrestricted access to student discounts.""I thought I was being clever, saving money on transportation and cultural events with the ID,"" Priya admitted. ""But when I tried to use it, I was caught and faced legal consequences,” she said.How to stay clearThe journey for Indian students in the UK is not only about academic excellence but also about resilience and vigilance in the face of scams. The lessons to be learned are clear: education isn't just about textbooks and lectures, it is also about navigating the real-world challenges that lay in wait for those seeking knowledge far from home.According to Kunal Mehra, Country Head of overseas education consultant Crimson Education, scammers seek to target individuals who have recently arrived at their international education destination because these students are more likely to be now aware of all the important information concerning housing, the Biometric Residence Permit (BRP), employment and internship rules, and banking guidelines.“Be it during the process of applying or studying, one should seek to be fully aware of the requirements, rules, and deadlines concerning admissions and visas,” he suggested.ALSO READ | 8.5 lakh students pursuing education abroad in just 4 focused countries: ReportMehra also recommends that students should reach out to the international students' department of the university they intend to study at before taking any steps based on information from a questionable source.Scammers often use urgency and pressure to manipulate individuals. Students need to take their time researching and making decisions. Legitimate processes typically do not require rushed actions.Besides, there are pre-departure briefings to help students prepare for their journey. These briefings are typically organised by the international offices or student services departments of universities.While specific details may vary from one university to another, some common topics covered in pre-departure briefings include visa and immigration procedures, financial planning, and travel information, among others.“When we write each pre-departure session, we discuss this in detail about the potential happenings. We make it clear to students that though they're travelling to low-crime countries, there's no such thing as a no-crime country,” said Fateh Education’s Singh, adding that one still needs to be aware and keep their senses irrespective of the location they are in.

These protocols will be different for different fruits and vegetables.The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), along with other stakeholders, has developed these protocols for bananas. APEDA is an arm of the commerce ministry.""With the successful trial shipment, India aims to export bananas worth over USD one billion in the next five years, opening doors to a diversified market portfolio through sea route,"" the official said.The trial shipment reached Rotterdam, Netherlands on December 5. The consignment was shipped from Baramati, Maharashtra.India's banana export destinations extend beyond the Middle East, with potential opportunities in major global players like the USA, Russia, Japan, Germany, China, the Netherlands, the UK, and France, the official added.Despite being the world's largest banana producer, India's export share is currently just one per cent in the global market, even though the country accounts for 26.45 per cent of the world's banana production at 35.36 million metric tonnes.In 2022-23, India exported bananas worth USD 176 million, equivalent to 0.36 MMT.The main banana producing states include Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh.Assistant Professor and expert on agri economics Chirala Shankar Rao said that huge export potential for bananas is there from Andhra Pradesh.APEDA's continuous efforts, including B2B exhibitions and the development of sea protocols for other fruits, highlight a proactive approach to boost India's agricultural exports, the official added.

But both sides did not show any desire for such a meeting. Instead, the two leaders in their official speeches at the ministerial huddle, targeted each other's countries through innuendoes and pointed jargon.Bilawal's choice of words, especially urging the participants not to let terrorism hinder political relations, irked many in India. Jaishankar in his address to the SCO meeting underscored the importance of stopping the issue of cross-border terrorism.Thus, Bilawal's trip, which was the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to India in almost 12 years, failed to repair the strained ties which remained frozen over the Kashmir issue.Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic relations with India by expelling its envoy in Islamabad and stopped trade ties following New Delhi's decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019 after abrogating Article 370 of the Constitution.In December, Pakistan's current caretaker government and Pakistani political leaders also reacted sharply to India's Supreme Court upholding the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution.As the year 2023 fades into history, it leaves a feeble ray of hope that changes may come in the India-Pakistan equation due to the changing regional situation and domestic compulsions.Pakistan has lately found itself in an enviable position due to the floundering of its gamble in Afghanistan. The Taliban takeover has badly backfired, as the rulers in Kabul have refused to break ties with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan militants, who are responsible for the endless bloodbath in the country, forcing Islamabad to recalibrate its stance and options.The immediate result has been the issuance of marching orders for hundreds and thousands of Afghans living illegally. So far, more than 400,000 have been expelled. The orders have not been reversed despite protests and threats by the Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan.Second, elections are slated to take place on February 8 next year, and former three-time premier Nawaz Sharif, who returned from the UK after a four-year self-exile, is likely to make a record fourth-time ascendancy to power.As a prelude to his rise to power, 73-year-old Sharif has been acquitted in all corruption cases and enjoys the protocols of a prime minister-designate.According to analysts, Sharif is considered an ardent advocate of having good ties with all neighbours, especially India. He made his intention clear while addressing his party leaders in Lahore on December 7, when he said that repairing diplomatic ties with neighbouring nations, including India, Afghanistan, and Iran, was on the agenda of his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.""How can you achieve global status when your neighbours are upset with you?"" he asked.Sharif, who had opposed the Kargil war of 1999 and was later ousted by then-military chief Pervez Musharraf because he was against this ""misadventure,"" said that he was right to oppose it.""Time has proved us right as far as the Kargil episode is concerned,"" he said, which may have been well received by his audience in India.Sharif talking about his successes during his previous tenures also included improvement in the ties with India and sought endorsement of his policy towards India by posing a question: ""During whose tenures did two Indian prime ministers visit Pakistan? First Atal Bihari Vajpayee and later Narendra Modi.""After his Lahore address, the leading Dawn newspaper quoted a political observer saying Sharif has a record of improving ties with India.""Improving ties with India has always remained a point of conflict between Nawaz and the establishment in the past. Whenever Nawaz Sharif came to power, he tried to shake hands with India against the wishes of the powers that be,"" the paper quoted the expert without identifying him.He enjoys good relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who, like him, is in a race to gain power for another term in the next year's elections. Their presence on the two countries' national scenes may help ease bilateral tension.Pakistan would also like to keep its eastern front quiet to focus on the Taliban threat. Caretaker foreign minister Jalil Abbas Gilani also referred to this point during a press conference after the Indian Supreme Court judgment on Kashmir status. When asked about the decision's impact on the security situation on the Line of Control, he said that Pakistan would like to maintain peace on the LoC.While Sharif's return is smooth, former cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan is struggling in jail to remain relevant in politics. He has alleged that his party members were targeted, arrested and stopped from filing nomination papers for the February 8 elections despite assurances from the top poll body and the judiciary.Khan, who was granted bail in the Cipher case, will remain in jail as he is convicted in the Toshakhana corruption case.On the economic front, cash-strapped Pakistan's economy has been in a free-fall mode for the last many years, bringing untold pressure on the poor masses in the form of unchecked inflation.Pakistan's shaken economy has compelled it to approach several nations seeking fiscal help in the form of loans. A loan package from the International Monetary Fund, approved in July, helped Pakistan avert a sovereign debt default. Under the USD 3 billion standby arrangement (SBA), Pakistan received USD 1.2 billion from the IMF as the first tranche in July.Pakistan has also been facing a rise in violence in the wake of the Taliban seizing power in Afghanistan in August 2021. Throughout this year, terrorists and separatists have been targeting security forces across Pakistan.The outgoing year saw the rise of a new militant outfit - Tehrik-e-Jihad Pakistan (TJP), a newly formed militant group that is an affiliate of the banned TTP. The group carried out multiple attacks targeting security forces including one of the worst terror attacks targeting the military in recent years that killed 23 soldiers in the restive Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in December's second week.On November 4, the TJP militants attacked the Pakistan Air Force's Mianwali Training Air Base, some 300 km from Lahore, damaging three grounded aircraft. A day earlier 17 soldiers were killed in three separate terror strikes in the country.Pakistan's establishment has said it will fight back till the menace of terrorism is eliminated.

Instead, the shareholders approved the appointment of Sanjay Khanna and Ravi Bhushan Puri as new directors.The Mint newspaper first reported the development on December 27.The latest flare-up is part of long-simmering tensions between the promoters and public shareholders led by special situations investor JC Flowers, which has flagged several instances of corporate governance lapses at the company, including Dish TV’s decision to write off around Rs 203 crore investment in its OTT streaming app Watcho in June last year.Minority shareholders have so far rejected several proposals by the current management led by Zee group founder Subhash Chandra and family, including the reappointment of Jawahar Goel, the younger brother of Subhash Chandra as managing director and the adoption of financial statements.Experts maintained that while the change in the company’s management was warranted, the onus of steering the company in the right direction lay with minority shareholders now.“This was long overdue at DishTV, but it is not clear whether JC Flowers has brought in a new board who can inspire confidence with shareholders,” Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of investor advisory firm InGovern Research Services, told Moneycontrol.Dish TV’s promoters, who currently own around 4% stake in the company, have sought to restrain JC Flowers from exercising voting rights and prevent its participation in the management and affairs of the company or claiming rights to the shares. In 2016, Chandra borrowed more than Rs 4,000 crore from Yes Bank against the shares of Dish TV and some real estate properties. After he was unable to service the debt, a part of the pledge was transferred to JC Flowers’s Asset Reconstruction Co., in which Yes Bank also owns a 9.99 per cent stake.

According to the data given by the government in the Parliament; a total of 1,23,781 employees have been recruited between FY 2019-20 and 2022-23. Of this, 14,106 were recruited in 2021-22 and 14,517 in 2022-23.“Governments claim based on individual bank management's reporting is far from the truth.

The insolvency law too has played a role in elimination of defaulting builders.According to real estate consultant Anarock, housing sales are estimated to rise by 30 per cent this year to a record 4.74 lakh units in primary (fresh sales) markets of top seven cities -- Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region), Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune.In value terms, the sales of residential properties are seen at a whopping Rs 4.5 lakh crore, supported by higher ticket prices.Housing prices, which started moving up from last year after remaining stagnant for almost a decade, continued an upward trend and appreciated by an average 14 per cent this year, encouraging investors to return to the primary residential market.""The changing sentiments of homebuyers -- wherein not only are home-renters converting into buyers but also buying bigger homes -- has played a huge contributing hand to sectoral and economic growth. The consumer has realised the importance of owning a home and we expect this sentiment to continue in the foreseeable future,"" realtors' apex body CREDAI President Boman Irani told PTI.Property developers and consultants are of the opinion that the industry is witnessing the ""best time"" and it is possibly in the first or second year of long-term upcycle.Sales were strong across price brackets, be it affordable, mid-income, premium and ultra-luxury homes, but what surprised everyone was the huge demand for properties starting from Rs 3-4 crore range to as high as Rs 100 crore.""The Indian residential real estate sector experienced remarkable growth in 2023, reaching a pinnacle not seen in the past 15 years. On the back of a strong Indian economy, real estate sector is seeing this robust end user-led growth in the residential demand and supply,"" Anarock's Chairman Anuj Puri said.He expressed confidence that the real estate market will grow further next year.""Given the ongoing developments and sustained momentum in the Indian economy and residential real estate sector, the upcoming year is poised for continued growth, although the rate of increase may be more moderate due to high base effect,"" Puri said.Sales are expected to surpass supply or maintain equilibrium, he said, adding that prices might rise 8-10 per cent in 2024 across major markets.Big branded developers having a good track record of executing projects reported sales of entire inventories in their project within a few days, as potential homebuyers and investors queued up to book their flats in large numbers, outstripping the supply.DLF, the country's largest real estate firm, announced in March sales of 1,137 luxury apartments, priced Rs 7 crore and above in its housing project in Gurugram for over Rs 8,000 crore within 3 days.DLF, Prestige Estates, Macrotech Developers and Godrej Properties all reported sales bookings between Rs 12,000 crore and Rs 15,000 crore during the last fiscal year and they expect to better their performance in 2023-24 fiscal.The consolidation in the housing market, in terms of both supply and demand, gained further momentum towards branded and trusted developers, prompting them to aggressively expand their land bank for future development.Among other segments of real estate, the demand for office space is estimated to remain flat this year at 37-39 million square feet across seven major cities. There were apprehensions that the leasing or absorption of office space would decline this year because of geopolitical concerns and global economic slowdown.The flexible space segment expanded their portfolio in a big way to meet demand from corporates who have started adopting managed workspace in lieu of conventional office to save cost and also get rid of facility management.Leasing of retail space in shopping malls and major high-street locations also increased as retail consumption surged.The year also saw India's first retail assets-backed REIT -- Nexus Select Trust -- sponsored by global investment firm Blackstone, which also made a complete exit from the country's first REIT -- Embassy Office Parks -- by selling 23.5 per cent stake for Rs 7,100 crore this month in open market transactions.REITs are Real Estate Investment Trusts.Builders also diversified their portfolio to develop warehousing projects and data centres projects. Co-living, which was badly hit during the pandemic, recovered a lot.In a nutshell, builders are upbeat that the housing market sustained strong demand and was able to post a healthy growth.Since 2022, the sector has been on an upswing and seems to have overcome disruptions caused by demonetisation, implementation of RERA and GST laws, NBFC crisis and the Covid pandemic.""The prospect of being the world's fastest-growing nation, coupled with current affordability levels, is expected to sustain the real estate momentum in 2024. Hopefully with inflation and interest rates getting moderated, we may see 2024 as a record year ahead of 2023 on both supply and demand for residential from end users,"" Puri said.If the growth trend continues, the size of the Indian real estate market will expand in a big way and may reach USD 5.8 trillion by 2047 from USD 477 billion last year, according to a recent NAREDCO-Knight Frank report.

Digitisation of mine records is also on the cards.In an interview to PTI, Coal Secretary Amrit Lal Meena said the government has already notified two policies with respect to coal gasification and plans to provide financial support as well as tax incentives for such projects.The ministry of coal has set a target to gasify 100 Million Tonnes (MT) of coal by FY 2030 in line with its energy transition plans.""Now, we are coming out with a policy for certain financial support and tax incentives (for coal gasification projects). This is under consideration... and we will ensure that coal gasification will see positive acceleration,"" Meena said.He also emphasised that the government is working to create an enabling environment to promote coal gasification.Coal gasification is expected to reduce imports by 2030 as well as reduce carbon emissions and foster sustainable practices.In order to address environmental concerns in the coal gasification process, the government has mandated grant of green clearance wherein the project proponent has to conduct environment impact assessment studies and prepare an environment management plan.The plan will be duly examined by an expert committee before taking up any activities related to establishment of a coal gasification plant.The Centre has also formulated a policy wherein, a provision has been made for 50 per cent rebate in revenue share for all future commercial coal block auctions for the fossil fuel used for gasification.This will be subject to the condition that the quantity used for gasification is at least 10 per cent of the total production.Separate auction window under the non-regulated sector has also been put in place for making coal available for new coal gasification plants.According to the secretary, out of the total 91 commercial blocks and 55 captive mines, 51 mines are currently operational. These blocks produced 116 MT of coal in the last financial year and the target is 162 MT for the current fiscal ending March 2024.The government is aiming to scale up coal production from underground mines to 100 MT by 2030 by deploying mass production technology.India's coal sector is the second largest in the world with production rising 14.8 per cent to 893 MT in 2022-2023 financial year. The country accounts for more than 10 per cent of the global coal production and is second after China.In order to achieve self-reliance in coal production and reduce imports, the government is working towards increasing the domestic coal production output to over 1 billion tonnes in 2023-2024 and further increase it to 1.5 billion tonnes by 2029-2030.For now, coal, which powers thermal power plants, is key for meeting the country's rising electricity demand.Regular reviews by the coal ministry to expedite the development of coal blocks and single window clearance portal for the sector, among other factors, have helped in increasing the production of the dry fuel.A Project Monitoring Unit has also been set up for hand-holding coal block allottees for obtaining various clearances for early operationalisation of coal mines.Ravi Pokharna, Executive Director of policy think tank Pahle India Foundation (PIF) said India is one of the fastest growing economies and it continues to be one of the key players driving global coal demand owing to its increasing energy needs.""This year also saw India reinforcing its commitments of achieving a 50 per cent power demand by non-fossil fuels by 2030... during COP 28, the Indian government did well to assert its right to continue using coal to fuel its growth, and demand developed economies to contribute to the transition in emerging economies,"" he said.Indian Federation of Green Energy Director General Sanjay Ganjoo said that based on the present use of biomass co-firing of 5-10 per cent, some 50-100 MT of coal will be replaced by biomass by 2030.""It is equivalent to reducing 90 to 180 million of CO2 emissions,"" he said.

Ultimately, banking does well when the economy does well. RBI recently revised India's growth projection from 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent,"" Kotak Mahindra Bank Whole Time Director Shanti Ekambaram told PTI.Growth seems to be robust. Credit demand started some 18 months ago with retail segment and it is now moving to capex, she added.On the flip side, she said that deposit growth has been slower than credit growth and that's the challenge that the banks have to address in the coming months.Although there is some increase in the deposit growth, there is still a significant gap of about 500 basis points when compared to loan growth.Aggregate deposits with banks increased 12.2 per cent during the 2023 April-November period as against 9.3 per cent a year ago.Credit growth moderated to 16.4 per cent as on December 1, 2023 from 17.5 per cent a year ago, as per the latest RBI Bulletin.Slower deposit mobilisation would result in a decline in Current Account and Savings Account (CASA) limiting room for rate reduction.As indicated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das in October, interest rate would remain high for some time.RBI is unlikely to cut policy rate at least for next six months, as per analysts.The demand for housing, car, education and personal loans would continue to witness a double-digit growth. However, there is a moderation in credit demand from the rural segment which is reflected in the decline in two wheeler and tractor sales.Even the Net Interest Margin (NIM) is expected to remain at over 3 per cent for most of the banks due to the elevated level of interest rate.A key positive factor for the banking sector is the decline in Non Performing Assets (NPAs) to a comfortable level and fresh slippages are also under control. It provides banks room to expand their balance sheets with focus on capital.NPAs declined as a result of the government's 4Rs strategy of Recognition, Resolution, Recapitalisation and Reforms, analysts said.According to RBI data, Gross NPAs or GNPAs of the Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) have declined in the last three years.It declined from Rs 8,35,051 crore (GNPA ratio of 7.33 per cent) as on March 31, 2021 to Rs 7,42,397 crore (GNPA ratio of 5.82 per cent) as on March 31, 2022. Further, the amount dropped to Rs 5,71,544 crore (GNPA ratio of 3.87 per cent) as on March 31, 2023.Similarly, these banks' GNPAs pertaining to corporates declined from Rs 5,15,150 crore as on March 31, 2021 to Rs 4,33,749 crore as on March 31, 2022. It stood at Rs 2,75,298 crore as on March 31, 2023.The robust performance of the banks in the first half of the current fiscal has been ably supported by a well-capitalised banking system that witnessed an upswing in credit disbursement to the retail, industry and services segments, according to the analysts.A major development in the banking sector this year was Uday Kotak's decision to step down as the MD and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank after steering the lender for almost two decades since its incorporation.His successor Ashok Vaswani will assume charge next year.While the financials of the banking system improved, there were instances of fraud. UCO Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed cyber frauds.Against this backdrop, the finance ministry held a meeting in November with all stakeholders to discuss issues related to cyber security in the financial services sector and increasing incidents of recent online financial frauds.The meeting took stock of the preparedness of the banks and other financial institutions in tackling the challenges arising from cyber security in the financial services sector and the need for a focused approach to mitigate cyber attacks and frauds.

After a long pause in US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) inspections on account of the pandemic, inspections were back in full swing in 2023.India's pharmaceutical exports saw a 37 percent (in terms of export value) rise from January to November, marking a positive trend. In terms of volume, the quantity was up 26 percent to over 63,000 tonnes in October 2023. India remained the largest generic drugs supplier to the US, contributing to almost 40 percent of the US market.Many top Indian companies reported record high sales in the US this year. For Q2 FY 24 results, Cipla achieved record-breaking quarterly sales of $229 million. In the same period, Lupin’s US sales crossed $200 million for the first time in nearly the last two years, while Sun Pharma reported US formulation sales of $430 million.Issues of substandard drugs continueIn late 2022, the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued an alert over child fatalities and adverse reactions to cough syrups in multiple countries, tracing some back to products originating in India. Throughout 2023, such incidents persisted, involving QP Pharma Chem's tainted syrups in the Marshall Islands and Micronesia, SyneCare in Nigeria, and the WHO flagging Fourrts Labs' cold Out in Iraq. Indiana Ophthalmics and Global Pharma faced serious allegations, including instances of eye damage in Sri Lanka and contamination in the US, linked to vision loss and a fatality.The common factor in the cases involving cough syrups was the presence of dangerous levels of toxic substances, particularly diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol. Manufacturers often denied responsibility, claiming these ingredients were not used, or attributing the issues to improper product administration. In the case of the eye drops, the issues were caused by contamination.Also read: Drug regulator issues warning against cold medication for children under 4 yrsIn response, Indian regulators took significant actions, inspecting 76 companies and revoking licenses of 18 of them producing spurious drugs. The government mandated rigorous testing of cough syrups before export, with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) temporarily pausing testing for other products. Regulators and industry associations, including the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) and the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA), initiated training and education for Indian entities.US FDA inspections surge after the Covid slowdownAfter a long pause in US FDA inspection during the pandemic, inspections were back in full swing in 2023. Among the 189 inspections, 20 plants received the highest level of action, Official Action Indicated (OAI), up from 12 in 2022 and 5 in 2021. Number of US FDA inspections in Indian manufacturing facilities have increased post CovidAs Indian companies are focusing more on specialty drugs, the frequency of inspections is expected to increase. “Inspections are a necessary part of the lifecycle of these companies. As time passes the standards required by the regulator will also increase. It is natural,” noted Manoj Garg, Director of Investments, WhiteOak Capital.US FDA Commissioner Robert M Califf had said in an interaction with CNBC TV 18 during his India visit in September, that the regulator will conduct more unannounced inspections.A US Congressional committee had said that US FDA inspections in China and India are “inadequate”. It said that plants in the countries show a “pattern of repeatedly violating FDA safety regulations” and indulged in destroying or falsifying data, and using non-sterile manufacturing processes. Number of serious regulatory actions against Indian pharma plants have increased in 2023“If you look at pharma it is at that inflection point. We can draw a lot of parallels between the Indian pharmaceutical industry today and the IT industry in 2000,” said Gauri Chaudhari, author of `The Perfect Pill: 10 Steps to Build a Strong Healthcare Brand’. “There must be constant training and education on quality and strict inspections for the implementation of the quality standards to help pharma take a leap like what IT took in the early 2000s,” she added.Also read: US FDA to step up unannounced inspections on Indian pharma plants Check Free Credit Score on Moneycontrol: Easily track your loans, get insights, and enjoy a ₹100 cashback on your first check!

Chief Secretary Atal Dullo also attended the meeting.The move is part of the Pradhan Mantri Kissan Urja Suraksha Evam Uthaan Mahaabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) scheme, encompassing grid-connected solar power plants with a capacity ranging from 1 kilo Watt to 15 kW, an official spokesperson said.Farmers participating in the scheme will be able to utilise solar power generated by these installations to fulfil their irrigation requirements, the spokesperson said.Besides, surplus solar power can be sold to distribution companies (discoms) and they will be obligated to compensate farmers based on the tariff set by the Jammu and Kashmir State Electricity Regulatory Commission (JKSERC).Apart from reducing pollution, the solarisation of agriculture pumps aims to offer farmers a reliable source of irrigation through solar-powered pumps, the spokesperson said.According to the spokesperson, the initiative is designed to mitigate revenue losses incurred by discoms that currently subsidise irrigation pumps at Rs 0.66 per unit of electricity, against the average tariff of Rs 3.50 for each unit.

However, the central government’s rural employment guarantee scheme does work as a safety net for the most vulnerable sections during the most crucial times such as COVID-19 and is hailed as a powerful instrument for inclusive growth in the rural sector.Thus, whether with a more reformed approach to plug leakages or a targeted approach with an Aadhaar-based payment system, the upcoming Union Budget is likely to allocate a substantial amount under the MGNREGA scheme for 2024-25.The law governing the flagship rural job programme provides guaranteed wage employment of 100 days in a financial year to a rural household whose adult members are willing to take up manual work. MGNREGA is a demand driven employment generating social protection scheme, which was passed by the Parliament in August 2005 and was implemented in February 2006 in the country’s poorest districts. Later, the scheme was extended to pan-India in 2008.MGNREGA was initiated as a safety measure to provide jobs between sowing and harvesting when there is a lean period.Budget allocationsFrom 2014-15 when it was at Rs 34,000 crore, MGNREGA allocation rose consistently to Rs 34,699 crore in 2015-16, Rs 38,500 crore in 2016-17, Rs 48,000 crore in 2017-18, Rs 55,000 crore in 2018-19 and Rs 60,000 crore in 2019-20. MGNREGA Budget AllocationThe Budget allocation for MGNREGA was reduced by 13 percent to Rs 61,500 crore in 2020-21 as compared to the actual expenditure of Rs 71,002 crore in 2019-20. The demand under the scheme rose drastically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognising the scheme as a potential source of employment during this crisis, its allocation was increased to Rs 1.11 lakh crore under the Atmanirbhar Bharat stimulus package.From the revised estimate of Budget allocation at Rs 89,400 crore towards MGNREGA in 2022-23, it saw a steep cut of 33 percent to Rs 60,000 crore for 2023-24.The demand for MGNREGA has surged in the current fiscal according to government data, owing to monsoon uncertainty also signaling a crunch in the urban jobs.Under the scheme, the central government provides 100 percent funding for wages for manual work.Top 5 MGNREGA hits Livelihood security: The scheme leads to an increase in rural consumption, enhances food security and nutrition, reduces poverty and has a positive impact on health and education. MGNREGA hitsWomen empowerment: Helps marginalised sections. Women's participation under MGNREGA has seen a consistent increase than men. From 2015-16 to 2021-22 the women's participation in MGNREGA every year has stood at 53 percent. It has now gone up to 57.8 percent in 2022-23.Positive impact on agricultural wages: The employment opportunities available under MGNREGA have kept the wages in rural areas relatively high.Reduction in distress migration: Reliance on money lenders has declined. MGNREGA has reduced migration by providing work closer to home with decent working conditions.Financial Inclusion: Despite some leakages, there is a positive impact on rural household income.Top 4 MGNREGA missesBogus demands: There are irregularities under MNREGA, for which complaints have been received. Some states are sending bogus demands, a top finance ministry source had alleged. The Aadhaar-based payment system has been in existence since 2016 but only in January 2023, it was made mandatory for receiving payment under the MGNREGA. The focus should be on plugging leaks in the rural job scheme to ensure that the benefits are only provided to deserving individuals. MGNREGA missesReforms in MGNREGA: The nine-member panel headed by former rural development secretary Amarjeet Sinha was set up in October 2022 and tasked with making the rural job guarantee scheme more effective. According to media reports, the committee has suggested an overhaul of the scheme by linking employment generation with asset creation. It also suggested increasing the budgetary allocation for the scheme and reassessment of wages every five years. But the finance ministry is not in favour of revamping the MGNREGA by increasing spending as recommended by the government appointed committee.Gap between allocation and expenditure: Budgeted funds under MGNREGA fail to keep up with expenditure incurred. They get exhausted before the end of the financial year. There is a gap between employment demand and employment provided.Lower days of employment: The MGNREGA guarantees 100 days of employment, but the actual average has been lower in most of the states.Expert Speak“The Budget allocation for MGNREGA has seen an increase over the years, reflecting a commitment to rural employment generation. MGNREGA has contributed to asset creation in rural areas, including the construction of infrastructure like roads, water conservation structures, and public assets. However, just like any other schemes, there have been opportunities for improvements specifically with reference to timely wage payments, improving transparency and improvement in the management of the schemes,” Ramendra Verma, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat told Moneycontrol.There are a few suggestions which can make MGNREGA relevant in the future as well. The government can consider incorporating skill development programs within MGNREGA that can enhance the employability of workers beyond the program's duration. Also, MGNREGA can explore diversification in the types of work offered, ensuring a more sustainable and varied source of employment like forestation, tourism related works, women empowerment, climate resilient projects, etc. Collaborative efforts involving central and state governments, local bodies, and NGOs can help address implementation challenges and ensure effective programme delivery, he said.“While MGNREGA has contributed significantly to rural employment and asset creation, addressing challenges related to payment delays, skill development, and program implementation is crucial. A forward-looking approach involving technological innovation, skill enhancement, and a commitment to transparency can help MGNREGA remain a vital tool for rural development in India,” Verma added.

Twenty of these will be located near the Lata Mangeshkar Chowk with 10 pillars on each side of the road,"" PWD Assistant Engineer A P Singh told PTI here.When PTI visited the road on Monday night, 10 pillars were already installed, while ornamental orbs on the 10 columns on the other side of the road were being mounted.""The other 20 pillars are located on the same road beyond the Satrangi Pul near the Saket petrol pump. Work is underway on that side as well and the aim is to complete the work by December 29,"" Singh said.Each pillar, made of reinforced cement concrete, has a decorative cladding made of a special fibre. It carries the chant 'Jai Shri Ram', a mace of Lord Hanuman and other ornamental motifs, the official said.""Ayodhya is the city of Lord Ram ji and Lord Hanuman,"" he added.The PWD official said the project was conceived in October and the installations began earlier this month.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is slated to arrive at the temple town on December 30. During his visit, Modi will inaugurate the redeveloped Ayodhya railway station and a new airport, and address a rally, officials earlier said.He will also hold a roadshow from the airport to the city, they said ""When the prime minister reaches Ayodhya by road after inaugurating the airport he will enter through this road and these 'Surya Stambhs' will welcome him to the temple town,"" Singh added.He said the contract for installing the sun-themed pillars was given to a private company that subcontracted a Mumbai-based firm for the work.Suncity Innovations, a manufacturer and supplier of street light poles and decorative poles, executed the casting work for the sun-themed pillars at its plant in Nashik.All 20 'Surya Stambhs' near the Lata Mangeshkar Chowk were installed by Tuesday, Sachin Nikumbh, a manager in the production team of the firm, told PTI.He said the burnish on the black-painted fibre surface is of copper powder while the orb is made of special glass fibre that gives it the glow.Nikumbh said whenever workers get tired or have to lift a heavy load, they chant 'Jai Shri Ram' and 'Jai Hanuman'.Sonu Sharma, a worker, said, ""We feel great working on this project as it is for Prabhu Shri Ram's temple. We are making a contribution towards it."" Special ornament lamp posts, bearing Hindu religion-themed motifs, have been erected on the road divider on this stretch.""The entire city is being decorated for the big day. Ayodhya will shine on January 22,"" Nikumbh said.Prime Minister Modi will take part in the ""pran pratishtha"", or the consecration ceremony of the Ram Lalla idol, on January 22.

It was a 15-year deal signed in September 2023. The deal termination comes at a time when IT companies around the world grapple with uncertainties and headwinds.The cancellation, though too early to be tagged the beginning of a trend, points at the fact that the IT sector is still in the troubled waters despite the western economies arguably wading through the crisis, stoking the possibility of a recession.Analysts and fund managers have also been hopeful about AI bringing dual benefits for the IT sector – more deals and less cost as AI can replace engineers. This cancellation of the deal is more likely a one-off setback, they believe.“It is one-off thing,” said Krathi Bathini, director for equity strategy at WealthMills Securities. “We don’t have much information regarding the reason behind deal cancellation but it will be interesting to see how the Infosys management responds to this in the earnings commentary next month.”Bathini pointed out that this instance does affirm that problems for IT companies are not over.Though, if we go by the management commentary, IT companies have been prepared for such a situation. “Delays in decision-making continues,” accepted Nilanjan Roy, then CFO of Infosys in the Q2 earnings call. He had said that clients were taking a conservative approach in signing deals in several verticals, including financial services, communication, energy, utilities, resources and services.The major concern for the industry has been reduction in discretionary spend by organisations across the world. IT spend for many companies comes under the discretionary head. For instance, in case of the Infosys deal cancellation, it is not necessary for a company to start their AI journey now and can be postponed.Everyone believes that such a scenario is likely more short term than one that is likely to persist. “You know that, like everybody in our industry, we have a certain volume of our business that is more discretionary,” said Thierry Delaporte, CEO of Wipro in his last earnings call. “We might be a little more exposed than some others because of our significant presence in the consulting business in particular. And even if we know that it will be the first one to bounce back when the demand is there.”Amid all this, large deal wins which are usually multi-year contracts have been on a rise. All top IT companies believe the momentum will continue on this front. However, one worry has been low revenue growth despite large deals flowing in rapidly.Companies believe there is a specific reason behind a stagnation in revenue growth.“The newly won deals are converting into revenue as expected, but these revenue inflows are getting neutralised by reduction in the existing revenue base as the transformation projects get completed... Or, in some cases, downsized. This has led to muted revenue growth,” said K Krithivasan, chief executive officer and managing director at TCS in his last earnings call.

In 2024, government estimates suggest the country is likely to add at least 20 GW of new coal fired capacity, for which the Union government has proposed to impose a lower Renewable Generation Obligation of 6-10 percent on new coal and lignite power plants, instead of 40 percent notified in March. Power sector events planned in 2024 so far.In the renewable energy (RE) sector, the government in 2023 announced policies ranging from withdrawing reverse bidding for wind energy projects to rules for the lease of seabed for offshore wind. It expanded the scope of its solar parks scheme to cover wind energy.Here are the top things to watch out for in the power sector in 2024:RE capacity: In 2023, RE capacity addition of around 20 GW is estimated, while the target is adding at least 25 GW in 2024, including 8 MW of wind energy, according to Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) officials. In 2023, the government announced a major policy to boost wherein four CPSUs — NTPC, NHPC, SJVN and SECI — were tasked with bidding for RE projects totalling 50 GW every year. Work on tenders that were floated in 2023 will begin in 2024. Besides, several private RE projects are also likely to be developed. Work for Khavda RE Park, the world’s largest, will be in full swing.Solar manufacturing: As of 2023, solar manufacturing capacities of at least 40 GW were operationalised. In 2024, the government aims to take this up to 50 GW at least. Several solar cell and module facilities by private players such as Tata Power and Adani are likely to increase production.Pumped storage projects: The government this year came out with guidelines for pumped storage projects. Accordingly, NTPC is planning to add 14,000 MW, while NHPC has been asked to explore capacities worth 22,000 MW. A host of private players including Tata Power, Torrent Power and Greenko are eyeing the segment. Battery storage systems are also likely to see more project announcements.Hydropower projects: The 2,000 MW Subansiri Lower project, under construction in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, is likely to be fully commissioned by December 2024. Besides, two units of the delayed Parbati-II project in Himachal Pradesh will start operations in April. The fate of the Tapovan Vishnugad project, stalled due to the land subsidence in Joshimath, is also likely to be decided by the courts in 2024. A few other smaller projects are also likely to be commissioned.Green Hydrogen: In 2024, one can expect mandates for hard-to-abate sectors such as refineries to adopt green hydrogen production. Work on creating facilities for GH2 production as well as electrolyser manufacturing will also begin since MNRE recently received bids for green hydrogen production and electrolyser manufacturing from companies such as Reliance Industries, Adani Group, Jindal India, L&T and BHEL.Green Energy Corridors: Feasibility studies for important green energy corridors such as the one planned between Leh and Kaithal will be undertaken in 2024. Construction of a few other GECs in states such as Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan are likely to be completed.Industry OutlookPratik Agarwal, MD, Sterlite Power:Strong policy support and reducing the cost of battery storage and pumped hydro development will enable supply of renewable power “on demand” as per the load profile of consumers or discoms, at prices beating new thermal power.Hitesh Doshi, CMD, Waaree Group and President, All Indian Solar Manufacturers Association:Our key expectations revolve around the continued evolution of regulatory frameworks, particularly in the context of the dynamic landscape shaped by the Basic Customs Duty, Approved List of Models and Manufacturers, and Production-Linked Incentives (PLI).In the year ahead, we anticipate heightened focus on technological advancements and adoption of innovative practices.Rohit Bajaj, ED - Business Development, Strategy and Regulatory Affairs, Indian Energy Exchange:In 2023, the introduction of General Network Access Regulations and the implementation of the Indian Electricity Grid Code proved to be pivotal for power exchanges. These regulatory frameworks not only resolved challenges but also facilitated seamless access to the transmission system, regardless of the type of Power Purchase Agreements in place.

With a ban on the export of de-oiled rice bran, the Association has projected exports of rapeseed meal and soymeal at 2.5 mln and 1.5 mln tn, respectively, in the current financial year. India's total oilmeal exports during Apr-Nov have increased by around 21% year-onyear to 2.8 mln tn, Jhunjhunwala said in the release. Demand for Indian soymeal in the international market was buoyant due to price competitiveness and shortage of supply by Argentina, he added. Also, rapeseed meal exports during Apr-Nov are at 1.6 mln tn and are likely to cross the record 2.3 mln tn exported last year, it said. The exports of castor meal are on track at 254,120 tn in Apr-Nov, higher than last year's exports of 235,200 tn during the year-ago period. Meanwhile, imports of refined, bleached, and deodorised palmolein are at 171,000 tn, which is more than twice that of the previous month, according to the release. Imports rose due to the low-duty difference of only 8.25% between crude and refined oils. ""This is to the detriment of our (India's) processing industry and of benefit to the exporting countries viz Indonesia and Malaysia,"" it said. The Association has recommended the government to increase the import duty on refined oil by at least 15% higher than that on crude cooking oil to enable the performance of domestic industry. As of Friday, the sowing area under oilseeds had reached 10.2 mln ha, largely unchanged from last year, according to data from the agriculture ministry. Rapeseed mustard leads the pack and covers a sowing area of 9.5 mln ha, against 9.3 mln ha a year ago. Though the sowing area under groundnut, sunflower, safflower, and seasamum currently shows a slight decline, rabi oilseed indicates a promising harvest as agriculture and climatic conditions are expected to be close to normal.For all commodities report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

But, lawyers and analysts say alternative investment fund managers could see costs ramp up and the rules will make it harder to raise cash in the future.“This is a sledge hammer to the industry,” said Vinod Joseph, partner at Economic Laws Practice, a legal firm.The top seven shadow lenders in the country had invested around $1.35 billion in these so-called AIFs, according to their most recent annual reports. Shares of these firms dived after the new rules, that directed existing investments to either be liquidated in 30 days or for lenders to provision their investment in the AIFs.The RBI’s move added to jitters in the market. Sentiment was already shaken after the central bank last month imposed stricter rules to stem the relentless rise in risky consumer loans, actions called “draconian” by one analyst. Its report on financial stability risks is set to be released this week.RBI has been concerned about round-tripping of potentially bad loans, rise of unsecured lending and heavier linkages between AIFs and regulated entities, all of which can “potentially build up stress in the financial sector,” said Abizer Diwanji, financial services leader at Ernst & Young India.RisksThe Securities & Exchange Board of India, the country’s capital markets regulator, had identified several dozen cases involving billions of dollars where AIFs were being used to get around rules, Ananth Narayan, a whole-time member at SEBI, told Bloomberg News.The flurry of new rules are coming at a time when India’s economy and financial system have remained resilient despite global headwinds of geopolitical tensions, elevated interest rates and inflation. Soured-debt ratios have narrowed to their lowest in a decade, with banks and shadow lenders boasting strong balance sheets as they reap gains from the rising demand for credit.Still, “seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked”, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das wrote in the financial stability report last December.“We do not wait for the house to catch fire and then act,” Das said separately while presenting the country’s monetary policy earlier this month. “Prudence at all times should be the guiding philosophy, both for the regulators and the regulated entities.”The regulations are already taking effect.Piramal Enterprises Ltd for example said more than 80% of its 38.2 billion rupees ($459 million) investment in AIFs went to debtor companies it had previously given loans to. The firm planned to adjust this amount via capital funds or provisions, the firm said in a filing.Another shadow lender IIFL Finance said 9.1 billion rupees in outstanding investments in AIFs will not be impacted by the RBI rule. However, its housing finance arm will need to liquidate or make provisions for 1.6 billion rupees worth of investments in AIFs, it said in a filing.ImpactSEBI’s Narayan said that any circumvention of financial rules by large lenders need to be addressed without imposing lopsided restrictions on those who comply.There can be unintended consequences however.It’s highly unlikely that lenders can find buyers for their stakes in the next 30 days, which would lead to losses as they make full provisions and take mark-to-market losses, EY’s Diwanji said. Some of these entities, especially the shadow lenders, may have to raise fresh funds after their capital gets depleted by the provisioning, he added.Future fundraising and deployment could however be impacted as banks and shadow lenders figure out how to avoid conflicts with their AIFs’ investments, according to Joseph, the partner at Economic Laws Practice.Already, some fund managers are pushing back and want the rules to be modified.These provisions “should be applicable to only investments in companies where the end use is towards refinancing existing debt and not towards growth,” said Eshwar Karra, chief executive officer at Kotak Strategic Situations Fund.

Rowe Price.""This is a big deal. We spent 2023 fearing that the impacts of tight monetary policy would drag the economy into recession. Happily, that did not happen, and a more dovish Fed means the likelihood of recession in 2024 has fallen considerably.""In the currency market, the dollar remained on the back foot and languished near a five-month low against a basket of currencies and a four-month trough against the euro.The common currency last bought $1.1032.The yen slipped 0.2% to 142.68 per dollar, with a summary of opinions from this month's Bank of Japan (BOJ) policy meeting showing that policymakers remain divided over if, and when, the central bank should move away from its ultra-loose monetary stance.While the board agreed to maintain massive stimulus for the time being, the nine members were split between those who were cautious about raising interest rates, and others who saw the need to start preparing for a future exit, the summary released on Wednesday showed.""The BOJ minutes sounded dovish with some members noting that upside inflation risks remained small, thus there was no need for 'rapid tightening',"" said Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.Elsewhere, Brent crude futures and U.S. WTI crude futures slipped, though stood not too far from their respective one-month highs hit in the previous session as further attacks on ships in the Red Sea prompted fears of shipping disruptions.Israel's war on Hamas will last for months, Israel's military chief said on Tuesday, while the United Nations voiced alarm over an escalation of Israeli attacks that killed more than 100 Palestinians over two days in part of the Gaza Strip.Brent fell 27 cents to $80.80 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 35 cents to $75.21.Spot gold fell 0.07% to $2,065.19 an ounce.

And, he is a no-nonsense person. As the Managing Director of Wheels India, the over Rs 4,300-crore Chennai-based auto component maker, Srivats Ram, has demonstrated a sense of positivity at all times.In this interview with Moneycontrol, he says the readiness of global players to source from India, compared to the past, has definitely improved in the last couple of years, following the de-risking strategy adopted by MNCs, he says.On infra spend, he says the government has been consistent over the last four years, and that the train has left the station and it can’t be stopped now.Edited excerpts:You are among the earliest to suggest that the supply-chain de-risking strategy of global companies will present an opportunity for Indian manufacturers. How has this panned out in recent times?There is definitely a move by MNCs (multinational companies) to de-risk their Chinese dependence, in terms of global sourcing, and India plays a part, especially where Indian companies are already present.The readiness of global players to source from India, compared to the past, has definitely improved in the last couple of years. It is a relatively new opportunity. US companies have increased their sourcing from Indian manufacturers and are clearly looking at India as an alternative destination.Indian manufacturers have indeed benefitted. If not for the China-plus-one opportunity, exports from India would have shrunk much more.The de-risking momentum is just starting to pick up steam. Hopefully, I do think that this strategy of MNCs will play itself out to India’s advantage and Indian companies should be able to gain additional business in the future.What are the current positives on the domestic market?The central government’s continued investment in infrastructure is a big positive as it has a multiplier effect in terms of employment opportunities and income generation across a cross-section of industries. The government has been consistent over the last four years or so on the infra spend. I do think that the train has left the station and it can’t be stopped now.What is your view on the immediate prospects of the commercial vehicle sector?There could be some improvement in the CV sector this Q4, compared to Q3.What will be the impact of the slowdown in the US and Europe on Indian exporters?The slowdown in Europe and the US is likely to have a near-term impact on exports from India. The slowdown in the US is relatively in the early stages. So, it’s unlikely to turn around in the immediate future. The high-interest rate scenario in developed economies will prove to be a deterrent for new investment by companies.Borderline investments will not go through when interest rates are increasing in economies around the world. On a positive note, however, the interest rate in the US could come down by mid next year and that could bring about a bit of optimism in the international markets.What would be the impact of the national elections on the domestic market?Elections bring a tinge of uncertainty for businesses that are looking to make investments for the future. There would be apprehension around the first quarter of next year. Till that bridge is crossed, companies will be cautious. I expect the first half of 2024 to be a bit sober for Indian companies. However, if there is a clear mandate in the elections, the second half of next year could be good for Indian businesses. I do see an infra fillip soon after the elections. A lot of private capex, too, could come in.Does GenNext look at the manufacturing sector as a lucrative career opportunity? There has been a trend in the past of GenNext in India looking at the IT sector for career growth. For a while, the aspiration of Indian grads has been to work in IT companies as opposed to manufacturing firms. Interestingly, we are now seeing those passing out even from top-notch professional colleges looking at the industrial sector for job opportunities. And that’s a positive sign for manufacturing firms.From where we are now, how do you see the outlook?After a quiet period around the national election, the country is likely to continue its growth trajectory. While the world is looking at sourcing from India, a slowdown in the global economy, especially in the US and Europe, could limit export growth next year. However, the long-term export prospects for Indian companies remain positive.

This prompted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to revise the FY24 GDP forecast to 7 percent. For FY25, the RBI projects a 6.5 percent average growth in the first three quarters.These optimistic GDP projections support analysts' bullish stance on the market, backed by a robust high-frequency data such as GST collections, auto sales, power demand, and manufacturing and services growth rate.Read: India's current account deficit narrows to $8.3 billion in July-SeptemberCorporate earnings in the first half of FY24 stood strong, with Nifty companies reporting a 30 percent growth in on-year net profit.

Also, the MPC retained the policy stance of withdrawal from accommodation.In a candid chat with Moneycontrol, MPC member Jayanth Varma said interest rates have peaked in India but the MPC may choose to wait for firmer evidence on the sustainable decline in inflation before cutting rates.Varma said the global slowdown and geopolitical uncertainty are the biggest risks to growth but monetary policy should strive not to allow high real interest rates to aggravate these risks.Also, the MPC member spoke about being a lonely voice in the MPC with respect to the policy stance saying even though other members may disagree with him on certain issues it doesn’t mean they don’t take him seriously. Edited excerpts from the interview:Do you think interest rates have peaked in India and, if yes, when can one expect a reversal in policy rates in your opinion?Yes, I do think that interest rates have peaked in India. I have made it clear in my statement that nominal rates will have to be cut soon to prevent an excessive rise in real interest rates as inflation trends downward. However, after three years of excessive inflation, there is an understandable reluctance to act without firmer evidence that inflation is coming down on a sustainable basis.What are the primary risk factors to growth in the Indian economy at this point and what needs to be done?The global slowdown and geopolitical uncertainty are, in my view, the biggest risks to growth. Monetary policy should strive not to allow high real interest rates to aggravate these risks.You have been the sole MPC member who has continuously voted against the continuation of the policy stance of withdrawal from accommodation. But, even without stating it officially, don’t you think MPC has shifted to a ‘neutral’ stance? It has kept the rates unchanged in the last 5 policy meetings. How is the official shift in stance important?I have argued in the past that the MPC is a statutory body whose statements must communicate in plain language to the general public. It is not enough that smart people can figure out what the MPC says, or that it does not mean what it says. It is not enough that insiders can fathom the coded language in which it chooses to speak. It is imperative that the MPC choose language that intelligent laypersons can interpret. In my view, the MPC has failed this test repeatedly.The IMF recently observed that MPC’s current policy stance is effective in bringing down inflation to the target. Interestingly, the IMF described the MPC’s policy stance as ‘neutral’ whereas in reality, it is not. Do you agree with this assessment?The neutral rate of interest is hard to estimate accurately but it is probably around 1 percent. The current real interest rate (based on projected inflation and money market rates close to the MSF) is around 2 percent. Even allowing for the uncertainty in the estimate of the neutral rate, I think the current interest rate is clearly restrictive.IMF also cautioned India on fiscal consolidation. The fund said India needs to do more and needs an “ambitious fiscal consolidation path” to rebuild its buffers and reduce debt in a sustainable manner. Your comments?The MPC should, in my view, avoid commenting on fiscal policy in order to preserve its independence in monetary policy. It should, of course, take the announced fiscal policy into account while framing monetary policy. India has been on the path of fiscal consolidation in the post Covid period, and this has to be partially offset by monetary policy to avoid adverse growth outcomes.Do you think RBI is helpless in prodding banks for effective monetary policy transmission?While there are lags in the process, I think there is a reasonably effective monetary policy transmission in India. Moreover, the marginal principle in economics implies that for most purposes, the rate of interest on fresh advances and deposits is more important than the average rate on outstanding balances.Do you think the bi-monthly meetings are too frequent considering the availability of very few data points in the 2-month interval? Should we go back to quarterly meetings?We live in a global world, and there is a large amount of data about the global economy that comes in on a virtually continuous basis. Financial markets also provide forward looking information on a continuous basis. So there is a mass of data to digest at each meeting. It might well happen that the incoming data is broadly in line with previous expectations and so there is no need to change course. In short, we do need frequent meetings, but many of those meetings might not result in any change in policy rates or stance.On a personal level, what are your key learnings as an MPC member so far with respect to the policymaking process? Do you feel that your views are not taken with the desired seriousness?It has been an incredibly satisfying experience and also a wonderful learning experience. I also believe that when people disagree with me, that does not mean that they do not take me seriously. Similarly, I pay serious attention to many views that I ultimately end up disagreeing with. The statutory principle of the MPC is that decisions are made by the majority and I respect and admire that principle. I have absolutely no complaints at all.How can India tackle the challenge of food price spikes as reflected in inflation? How much control does the RBI have on food inflation?Supply shocks in food or other commodities should lead to a change in relative prices but not in the general price level in the long run. Relative price changes are the mechanism through which a market economy copes with these shocks. It is the job of monetary policy to prevent the generalisation of food price inflation through second-round effects. The bigger challenge of food price shocks is their distributional effects as they fall disproportionately on economically weaker sections of society. The government’s supply-side responses are instrumental in tackling this challenge.If you were the advisor to the central government, what are the areas where you envision immediate fiscal attention ahead of the vote on account?I do not wish to answer this question as an MPC member.

The year 2023, in this regard, was a seminal one, not only because of the various developments that it unveiled in the domains of AI, chip design, augmented reality, Wi-Fi, etc., but also for the platform that it has built for future innovations.2024, therefore, promises to be a fascinating year in the realm of technology, with significantly more sophisticated systems getting built, greater ubiquity of these powerful systems, and novel end-use applications being created to leverage this newfound potential. So, as we usher in this new year, here’s some musings about what we can expect going forward, and what there is to be excited and concerned about in the coming year.AI Everywhere2023 saw AI dominate the headlines, with ChatGPT and OpenAI leading the hype train. And, in 2024, we can expect more of this same trend. Part of this is due to the vast untapped potential of this sector, which has only recently found expression. Another reason is the competition induced progress that this space will see in the coming years.Currently, all major chip designers are trying to find ways of stealing an advantage over their competitors in the generative AI game, leading to an increasing spread of devices that contain dedicated AI processing hardware.Whether it is Intel with their new Meteor Lake chips (they plan to ship out 100 million units by 2025) that has their first integrated NPU (Neural processing engine), or AMD’s recently launched Instinct MI300 series of chips, or Snapdragon with their 8 Gen 3 chips that bring on-device support for models with up to 10 billion parameters, or with Apple rapidly making gains in performance on their neural engines in their iPhones. Nearly every major player wants to get ahead in the AI game. And, we can expect dedicated AI hardware to become as commonplace as the Bluetooth modem, starting next year.AI – Larger SystemsThe development paradigm of AI follows the law of scaling, which basically asserts that with more computational power and larger datasets, the capability of the final model improves across the board. Now, as the AI wars heat up and the biggest, most cash-rich firms try to pull ahead, we will see immense resources being deployed to train the largest and most sophisticated models.Recently, Google released its Gemini model where the Ultra variant is rumoured to have over 1.5 trillion parameters and cost around $1-2 billion to develop. Similarly, Anthropic is ready to transition to billion-dollar models by 2024. And OpenAI is also certainly already spending the same ballpark amount to train its next-generation GPT 5 model.As a result of all of this, we can expect 2024 to be a year of huge multimodal AI systems, with impressive general intelligence levels. This process will also be further accelerated by the new chips that have been released by Nvidia and AMD, including their H200 and Instinct MI300 series of chips, respectively, which can process far larger datasets at vastly higher speeds.A Year Of RegulationEU, in the month of December, passed their provisional AI Act which groups AI applications into four risk levels, and regulates them according to their potential harms. President Biden passed an executive order in late October on a safe, secure, and trustworthy Artificial intelligence. And India, aiming to enact a light touch regulatory framework for AI, is also debating and drafting regulation for AI.2024, the largest election year in recent memory for G20 nations, should see this process of regulation of AI get ramped up dramatically. With disinformation, deepfakes, and social engineering poised to occur yet again for election manipulation, using AI, we can expect 2024 to churn up various new interesting debates on regulation, and governments taking the task of its regulation far more urgently.Augmented Reality And Virtual RealityWith the launch of Apple Vision Pro in 2024, that will take the capabilities of AR and VR to the next level, to the Meta & Ray-Ban’s smart glasses, which are the first real attempt at a discrete everyday-wear smart glasses since Google Glass, there is a lot to be excited about in this space. Lightweight, longer lasting headsets, with much higher resolution and processing power will be the theme of AR and VR in 2024.Material Sciences ProgressIn November 2023, Google revealed that its DeepMind researchers had utilised the AI tool called GNoME to discover over 2.2 million crystal structures, in a massive win for material science. The paper in Nature which details these findings states that this is more than 45 times larger than the number of such substances unearthed in the history of science (which total 48,000) and worth about 800 years of experimental research.Now, in 2024, we can expect to see much R&D going into exploring these crystals, a task that will lead to major downstream impacts on renewable energy, superconductors, battery technology, advanced computation, and much more.Wi-Fi 7With the proliferation of smart devices and the consequent boom in the number of connected devices, our requirements from existing Wi-Fi protocols and routers have been constantly expanding. To address these rising demands, the next generation protocol (Wi-Fi 7) has been engineered to be a major leap forward.Promising speeds that are 4.8 times faster, latency that is 100 times lower, and network capacity that is 5 times larger, the improvements will substantially improve the standard from Wi-Fi 6. In 2024 we should see mass adoption of this standard through new devices being sold, and applications such as 8k streaming and multiplayer gaming seeing major improvements.Overall, these are but a few developments that we will see in the tech space. Ongoing wars will likely cause new forms of cyberattacks and cyberweapons to be deployed. China will make new strides in their chipmaking efforts to reach parity with the West, strides towards AGI or Artificial General Intelligence will be made, the marketplaces of Google and Apple will face more lawsuits for monopolistic behaviour, and Javascript libraries will see greater integration with AI coding assistants, among various other developments.Tech, as usual therefore, will be a cornucopia of changes and developments that promises to leave every follower bewildered and fascinated.Srimant Mishra is a computer engineer and lawyer with a deep interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

Bulls rule Dalal Street, rally takes Sensex valuation to two-year highThe recent rally in India’s stock markets has pushed the valuation of Sensex to a two-year high, which is presently trading at a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of 25.2X, up from 23.7X in December last year and the highest since January 2022, when it was at 26.9X. The gauges current price-to-book value is 3.7X, the highest since November 2021. This rise in valuation follows a nearly three years of steady decline when corporate earnings grew much faster than stock prices.Why it’s important: Most of the gains in equity valuation has come in the past two months after a sharp reversal in US treasury yields that saw overseas investors rush into emerging markets. The high valuation could presage a period of slower earnings growth.#2. India consolidates position as fifth-largest equity market on relentless rallyIndia’s share in global market cap has hit a record 3.8 percent, Bloomberg data sahow, consolidating the country’s position as the fifth biggest equity market, just behind Hong Kong. The difference between Hong Kong and India has narrowed sharply to $500 billion compared with $1.9 lakh crore a year ago. India’s market cap is up 0.52 percentage point in 2023.Why it’s important: A sustained domestic market rally has lifted benchmark indices by as much as 16 percent this year, reflecting optimism over the country’s long-term growth prospects.#3. Assets of India’s mutual funds surge by 24 percent between January and NovemberThe assets under management of the Indian mutual fund industry have risen by as much as 24 percent to Rs 49.05 lakh crore in November against Rs 39.62-lakh crore in January. The net inflows into mutual funds so far this year more than doubled to Rs 25,616 crore last month against Rs 11,373 crore in January.Why it’s important: The significant rise underscores the interest of India’s middle-class savers to participate in the huge rally in the equity markets that led to a substantial jump in inflows, which are expected to continue.Also Read | Listing today: Happy Forgings set for stellar debut on the bourses#4. Promoters of Adani Green Energy to infuse Rs 9,350 crore via preferential warrantsAdani Green Energy will raise Rs 9,350 crore by issuing preferential warrants to promoters to achieve its target of 45GW of eco-friendly energy capacity by 2030. Its board has approved a preferential issue of 63.14 million warrants to promoters at Rs 1,480.75 each. The infusion would be used to retire debt and hasten capital expenditure, the company said.Why it’s important: India is rapidly becoming a global leader in renewable energy and Adani Green is back on track to make the most of it by swiftly expanding its business operations after a market setback earlier in the year that saw its stock price decline by nearly 80 percent.#5. Apple in advanced discussions with component makers Aequs and RayprusApple is in advanced talks with parts makers such as India’s Aequs Group and Taiwanese camera and lens maker Rayprus Technologies. Aequs makes high-quality toys, consumer durables and aerospace parts in India, US and France while Rayprus is an arm of Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn and makes high-quality precision camera and lens solutions. Apple is also in preliminary talks with local firm Dixon Technologies.Why it’s important: The latest development shows that Apple is making concerted moves to deepen its manufacturing operations in India in order to diversify supply chains away from China.#6. Dish TV India shareholders oust company board, two new members joinShareholders of Dish TV India have rejected the candidature of its remaining four independent directors. Over 71 percent of shareholders voted against appointing them at an extraordinary general meeting, the firm said in a regulatory filing. As many as 13 directors have been fired from Dish TV by shareholders since September 2021, when Yes Bank, the then-largest investor, raised the banner of revolt.Why it’s important: India’s third-largest satellite television provider have been facing charges of poor governance from shareholders, who have Shareholders have raised concerns around its recent investments and the composition of the board. Dish TV denies any wrongdoing.#7. Start-ups secure Rs 1.5 billion in December but funding winter might not be overDecember was the busiest month of 2023 for risk capital investors, who announced over $1.5 billion in funding, which tops January’s $1.4 billion, data compiled until December 26 by Tracxn showed. However, most industry watchers would be cautious about terming it the end of the funding winter.Why it’s important: Start-up funding in India in 2023 remains at a seven-year low. The funding environment is expected to remain sluggish going into the new year.Also Read | Stock Market Today: Top 10 things to know before the market opens#8. Regulator may allow alternative investment funds to pledge share in investee firmsThe Securities and Exchange Board of India is considering a plan to allow alternative investment funds to pledge their shares in investee companies. If a special purpose vehicle operating a project seeks a loan, banks insist on promoters pledging shares as security. If an AIF is promoter or controlling shareholder, this is difficult unless the fund can pledge the shares. Currently there are restrictions on this.Why it’s important: Till recently, the regulator was not in favor of AIFs pledging securities of their portfolio companies with banks. It may now allow pledging for legitimate purposes.#9. European regulator hosts meetings to resolve impasse over clearinghouse oversightThe European Securities and Markets Authority has held meetings over the past few days with German and French regulators to resolve an oversight impasse involving India’s primary bond clearing house, following London’s lead in protecting the interests of lenders from continental Europe, such as BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, which operate in Mumbai’s globalized sovereign debt market.Why it’s important: The European regulator in October 2022 derecognized the Clearing Corporation of India after the Reserve Bank declined to allows rights of overseas audit and inspection. ESMA might now be on the verge of changing its tune.#10. Current account deficit declines to 1 percent as merchandise trade deficit narrowsIndia’s current account deficit fell to 1 percent of GDP in the fiscal second quarter, down from 3.8 percent a year ago. The decline was largely due to a narrowing of the merchandise trade deficit from $78.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022-23 to $61 billion in the three months to December, Reserve Bank data showed.Why it’s important: the deficit is expected to rise again in the December quarter. It is expected to remain in the range of 1.5 to 1.6 percent of GDP unless commodity prices rise sharply.

Harbouring the dream of ensuring the financial well-being of their loved ones, making investments in India proves to be a smart option for them. With a plethora of investment options ranging from equities and mutual funds (MFs) to fixed deposits (FDs) and debt funds, the investment landscape in India holds immense promise.As one of the emerging economies in the world, the Government of India has allowed non-resident Indians (NRIs) to invest in MFs in conjunction with the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) rules of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), ensuring that the investment process is transparent. However, it is important to note that certain asset management companies (AMCs) don’t accept MF applications from NRIs based in Canada and the US.Decoding the MF investment process in India for NRIs To invest in the Indian MF market, NRIs need to open an NRO or NRE bank account with an Indian bank. Since AMCs are not allowed to accept investments in foreign currencies, NRI investments are made in Indian rupees, easing the entire investment and return process.To enter the Indian mutual fund market, NRIs can proceed in two different ways. In the direct procedure, they can initiate the process on their own by submitting their application with the required know-your-customer (KYC) details indicating whether the investment is on a repatriable or non-repatriable basis. In case the bank requires in-person verification, they need to comply by visiting the Indian embassy in their resident country with the required documents.The other mode is where the NRI can give a Power of Attorney (PoA) to a person to make investment decisions and invest on his/her behalf. However, the signatures of both the NRI investor and the PoA holder must be affixed to the KYC documents for investing in MFs in India.Also read: Confused about which mutual funds to invest in? Check out MC30Beyond the Barrier: MF regulations for NRIsKYC compliance: Every NRI desiring to invest in MFs in India must clear the KYC process. The process involves submitting several documents: an attested copy of a passport, a PAN card, a recent photo, a bank statement, and address proof. It is mandatory to provide current residential proof, whether it's temporary or permanent.FEMA declaration: When making foreign transactions, it's compulsory to abide by the country’s regulations. As a requisite, NRIs must provide a declaration in conjunction with the guidelines of the FEMA to certify that the investment funds comply with all Indian regulations.Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate (FIRC): NRIs need to make payments for MF investments via cheque or demand draft. Also, an FIRC must be attached to confirm the source of funds. In the absence of a certificate, a letter from the bank is acceptable.Redemption steps: Upon maturity of an MF investment or voluntary exit, the AMC will credit the corpus directly to the NRE/NRO bank account after deducting applicable taxes, if any. However, if the NRI opts for a non-repatriable investment, then the proceeds can only be credited to an NRO account.Also read: Explained: Why NRIs must either close or convert their Indian bank accountsTax implications: Many NRI investors worry that they will have to pay double tax when they invest in India. Well, that is certainly not true if India has signed the Double Taxation Avoidance Treaty (DTAA) with the country of your residence.Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA): The Act, effective from January 2016, makes it mandatory for all Indian and NRI investors, both existing and new, to file a FATCA self-declaration for FDs, MFs, and more. The specific inclusion that applies to NRIs based in the US for US tax purposes is valid even after they move to India and holding Indian residency status.Bottomline  For NRIs, the opportunity to invest in the Indian MF space holds immense potential, being both lucrative and feasible. By staying informed and well-versed in the investment regulations, NRIs can seamlessly navigate through the MF landscape of India without any hurdles and secure their financial future in their home country.

Stocks related to real estate, industrials and capital goods are among those leading the gains, while Adani Group companies — the heavy hitters of 2022 — are mostly finishing with losses despite a rebound in recent months.As the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index heads for an eighth year of gains with returns of 17% in 2023, expectations that the party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will win elections in 2024 are raising hopes this bull run may continue.Global funds have bought more than $20 billion of local shares in 2023, after taking out $17 billion last year, signaling investors’ preference for India as China grapples with an economic slowdown.Here’s a look at some of the significant stock moves of 2023:Real EstateA measure of real estate stocks rallied to its highest level since 2008, outpacing all other sector indexes managed by the BSE Ltd. A pause in interest-rate hikes, demand for luxury housing and investments by Indians living abroad boosted developers. Prestige Estates Projects Ltd. surged about 140%, while DLF Ltd. almost doubled.“A combination of a strong pent-up demand for housing, above average affordability and 12-year low unsold inventory should drive a multi-year virtuous housing cycle,” according to a Jefferies note this month.InfrastructureEngineering behemoth Larsen & Toubro Ltd. and UltraTech Cement Ltd. ranked among the top performers on the benchmark gauge, underscoring the focus on building infrastructure in the world’s most-populous nation.“Cement is a good way to play real estate and infrastructure sectors in India and it can do well in 2024,” said Arun Malhotra, a fund manager with CapGrow Capital Advisors LLP. “We have seen real estate activity remaining firm and companies getting strong bookings for projects.”State-owned firms had their best year since 2009 as the government ramped up spending. While NTPC Ltd. and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd. led the gains on the key 30-member index, lenders of state projects, including REC Ltd. and Power Finance Corp., surged more than 200% each.Small- and Mid-CapsThe stellar performance of small cap stocks saw investors flocking to benefit from the gains, with many asset managers opening new funds to capitalize on the demand.Stocks including AurionPro Solutions Ltd. and Titagarh Rail Systems Ltd. climbed 546% and 365%, respectively. Among notable mid-cap winners are Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., Trent Ltd. and Polycab India Ltd.For next year, Kotak Securities prefers mega-caps due to their valuations and “greater immunity in the event of any negative developments in the next few months,” the brokerage said in a note dated Dec. 18.Adani, VedantaFour companies of the Adani Group are among the worst 10 performers on the S&P BSE 200 Index this year, with flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. down more than 25%. The conglomerate drew global attention after a scathing report from shortseller Hindenburg Research in January triggered a stock rout.Although some of its businesses with lucrative assets such as Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd. and Adani Power Ltd. have climbed beyond their pre-report levels, most of group’s stocks are yet to fully recover the losses.Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd. lost 15% this year, with investors wary of the mining giant’s heavy debt load.Tech, EVNew-age technology companies staged a comeback, with Zomato Ltd. more than doubling in value on growth in online food orders. Tata Motors Ltd. is among the top-performers on the Sensex this year, having soared 85% to a fresh record and underlining India’s push to embrace electric-vehicles for clean energy.

The deadline for completing nomination for existing MF investments was fixed as March 31, 2023. Investors would have to either choose a nominee/s or opt out of the nomination by way of a signed declaration form by the set deadline.Based on representation from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), the deadline for compulsory nomination for all new investments was extended from August to October 2022. And then, as existing MF unitholders, especially those with jointly held investments, struggled to complete their nomination, their deadline was extended, first from March 31 to September 30, 2023, and then to January 1, 2024.If you still haven’t completed your MF nominations, this week is your last chance to do so. Failure to do so would result in your MF folios being frozen for any debits. That is, you will not be able to redeem/make withdrawals from any of these folios but you can continue investing in them.According to the registrar and transfer agent (RTA) CAMS, about 25 lakh PAN holders had not updated their nomination as of September-end 2023. An email sent to CAMS asking for the latest data remained unanswered.So how can you update your MF nomination?Singly-held folios updating nomination Updating nominations for singly held MF folios is fairly straightforward. You can select a nominee or update an existing nominee’s details, or opt out of nomination. This can be done online on CAMS, K-Fintech or MF Central, an online platform created by the two RTAs. With MF Central you can do this for all your folios across all fund houses, whether serviced by CAMS or KFintech.If you are unable to do this online, you can submit physical nomination forms.Updating nomination for jointly held folios As highlighted in our earlier article, many investors with jointly held MF folios (investment in the name of more than one person) have faced problems in updating their nominations online. This is because it requires the consent of all the joint holders. When done online, it requires all the joint holders to receive OTPs for authentication and when done via physical form submission, it requires the signatures of all the joint holders.To be able to update nominations online on CAMS or KFinetch, the MF folio must have the contact details of all the joint holders. Alternatively, you can submit physical nomination forms at the CAMS and KFintech branches to get this done. Note that you cannot use MF Central to update nominations for jointly held folios.Furthermore, as a new investor, you can also use Mutual Funds Utility (MFU), a platform backed by the MF industry and AMFI, to fill in your nomination details online or opt out of nomination. You can do this both for singly or jointly held folios. But if you are an existing investor, you can do this only via submission of physical nomination forms and not online.Also read: Confused about which mutual funds to invest in? Check out MC30Submitting physical forms Those with investments in only one fund house can download the nomination form from the website of that fund house or the relevant RTA and submit it to either of them. Those with investments across multiple fund houses can download the forms simply from the relevant RTA websites, and then submit them to the RTAs or each of the fund houses.You can use one form for updating the nomination for up to three folios (with the same fund house) if you have chosen the same nominees for all three folios. For different nominees across different folios, you will have to use separate forms.Also, if you decide to take the offline route, be careful about your signature. According to mutual fund distributors we had spoken with earlier, many forms were getting rejected because of signature mismatch as people’s signatures tend to change over time.Given that the MF nomination deadline has already been extended twice, it’s best not to hope for yet another extension. With only a few days to go until January 1, start on this right away if you haven’t done so already.

On December 26, the BSE Sensex climbed 230 points to 71,337, while the Nifty 50 was up 92 points at 21,441 and formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with higher highs and higher low for yet another session.Overall, the Nifty has now retraced a good portion of the significant losses seen on December 20. ""The Nifty would need to cross the recent highs of 21,593 to reverse the current downtrend. Crucial supports to watch for re-emergence of weakness are at 21,329-21,232,"" Subash Gangadharan, senior technical and derivative analyst at HDFC Securities said.Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst at Angel One also feels the upcoming sessions around the 21,550 - 21,600 range are critical, representing a formidable resistance formed by the reciprocal retracement of the October decline.The pivot point calculator indicates that the Nifty is likely to see immediate resistance at 21,455, followed by 21,507 and 21,564 levels, while on the lower side, it can take support at 21,360, followed by 21,325 and 21,268 levels.Stay tuned to Moneycontrol to find out what happens in the currency and equity markets today.

Despite weaker volume, Tuesday’s moves likely signal a continuation of the positive market trends boosting major indices in recent weeks, said Keith Lerner, Truist’s co-chief investment officer.“You still have money dripping in even though it’s weakened, and a solid bid underneath the surface as we head into year end,” he said. “That’s likely to continue.”European MarketsEuropean stocks rose slightly Friday, after US stocks strongly rebounded from their worst session in months. The Stoxx 600 index inched up 0.114 percent in London, as the technology sector dropped 1.3 percent.

It added that AGEL is now fully equipped to achieve its stated target of 45 GW by 2030, with 20.6 GW locked in capacity, secured land of over 2,00,000 acres (equivalent to over 40 GW of additional capacity) in resource rich areas of India, and additional equity infusion of Rs 9,350 crore which fully funds this stated target.""India is on the cusp of becoming a global leader in renewable energy and Adani Green Energy is in the vanguard of this revolution,” said Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group.Oil PricesOil jumped over 2 percent on Tuesday to the highest in almost a month, supported by the Middle East strife and investor optimism that the U.S. Federal Reserve would soon start cutting interest rates, boosting global economic growth and fuel demand.The rally, in thin trade with some markets closed for public holidays, added to last week’s gains of about 3 percent after Houthi attacks on ships disrupted global shipping and trade while the Israel-Hamas conflict shows no sign of easing. Brent crude futures were up by $1.79, or 2.3 percent, at $80.86 a barrel and earlier reached $81.23, the highest since December 1. US West Texas Intermediate crude rose by $1.89, or 2.6 percent, to $75.45.Despite concern about the Middle East and the re-routing of ships, actual supply has not yet been affected. Maersk on Sunday announced the restart of shipping routes through the Red Sea, easing the concerns to some extent.Dollar IndexThe Dollar index traded 0.06 percent lower in futures at 103.32, whereas the value of one dollar hovered near Rs 83.09.Gold PricesGold prices rose on Tuesday, helped by a weaker US dollar and lower Treasury yields on expectations that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates next year. Spot gold was up 0.4 percent at $2,062.63 an ounce near 7:30am ET after hitting a more than two-week high of $2,070.39 in the previous session. US gold futures rose 0.2 percent to $2,073.20.Trading was thin on the day after Christmas with several markets closed for public holidays, and was expected to remain muted across the shortened week. “The main factor supporting gold is still the expectation of dovish central banks and falling rates in the next few years,” said Kinesis Money analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa. There is a good chance gold could stay above $2,000 in 2024, De Casa added, pointing to continuing geopolitical tensions.Stock under F&O ban on NSEThe NSE has added RBL Bank to its F&O ban list for December 27, while retaining Balrampur Chini Mills, Delta Corp, Hindustan Copper, and National Aluminium Company on the list.

As India is poised to become an economic superpower in coming years, rising energy demand is expected to drive accelerated infrastructure creation in segments of renewal power generation and transmission.On top of it, innovative financing solutions such as infrastructure investment trusts (InVits) and green bonds are enticing developers to invest towards capacity creation in the power sector. This bodes well for the growth of sector in the medium term, however current valuations of power stocks don’t leave any margin of safety for the investors. So, this would be prudent to wait for a more suitable entry point.Also read: How India’s bond market evolved over the last 10 budgets under Modi govtQ: Which are the sectors/themes that you selected for investment for 2024?We prefer sectors which offer margin of safety with respect to either earnings or the valuations. In the current context, we believe large banks offer margin of safety on both the fronts as they are expected to grow at 15 percent in the next year despite building in NIM (net interest margin) compressions and trading at below long-term average valuations.Additionally, in our view IT sector is trading at reasonable valuations. By H2 of CY24, some pickup in demand is expected to be witnessed in the sector as well. Hence, IT sector also looks to be suitable for investing.Apart from this, sectors such as oil & gas primarily led by OMCs (oil marketing companies) and gas companies and pharmaceuticals (formulations players) offer decent risk adjusted returns from these levels.Also read: India's current account deficit narrows to $8.3 billion in July-SeptemberQ: Do you expect similar (2023) kind of returns from the equity benchmarks in 2024 too? Factors that you think are already discounted by the market.Nifty is currently trading at around 20X FY25 EPS after recent run up in the last two months. This level is approximately one standard deviation above the historical average, but it is not in a super expensive zone. So, from current valuation levels, upside looks fairly limited despite the healthy expected earnings growth of the index.Hence, in our view markets may deliver high single digit returns from current levels but double-digit returns would be difficult to achieve. Additionally, market already seems to have discounted major portion of expected earnings growth of the next year leaving little room for incremental appreciation.Q: Where do you want to invest for 2024, if you have Rs 10 lakh?From the asset allocation perspective, it would be prudent for an investor to stick to his/her long-term investment objectives while being mindful of one’s risk appetite. In the current market context, equity valuations look a bit stretched, hence fresh equity allocation shouldn’t be very aggressive.Also read: RBI releases draft licensing framework for authorised persons under forex lawAt the same time, expectations of interest rates decline in H2CY24 make bonds slightly more lucrative. Overall, investors should consult their financial advisors to make appropriate changes to their asset allocations in accordance with their long-term investment goals.Q: Do you expect the DIIs and retail flow in equity to remain strong in the coming year too, or much more than previous year?With consistent GDP growth, discretionary savings pool of middle class of India is rising every year. Additionally, as is evident by meteoric rise in overall demat accounts of investors, awareness and understanding about equity investing in the country is witnessing rapid enrichment. This coupled with subdued returns in other asset classes such as real estate, is making equity a preferred asset class for domestic investors.In this backdrop, we believe, DII and retail flows are expected to remain buoyant in the coming year too, however this is not expected to be significantly higher than previous year as return expectations from CY24 is lower than that generated in CY23. Relatively lower returns than previous year and higher volatility of equity will incentivize investors to diversify a portion of their corpus by investing in bonds/bank deposits as well.Q: Do you expect the Fed to start interest rate cut in the first quarter of 2024 and will it be more than 3 cuts in 2024?As inflation in the US has come down to 3.1 percent in November 2023 from a significantly higher level of 9.1 percent in June 2022, it has given the Fed sufficient headroom to cut rates hereon. As inflation is still meaningfully away from official target of 2 percent, hence we expect Fed to start cutting interest rates only in Q2CY24 after monitoring additional data points on inflation, unemployment, and GDP.Additionally, it is expected to implement 3 rate cuts in 2024 in a calibrated manner. Possibilities of additional rate cuts arise only if US economy falls into a deep recession, which in our view is a low probability event.Q: Are you super bullish on the PSU space, even after stellar run they posted in the past quarters?We aren’t extremely bullish on PSU space anymore. In our view, undervaluation in PSU stocks has been well captured by investors in past few quarters and now they are trading at fair valuations. They aren’t very expensive either and offer balance risk reward. Hence bottom-up stock picking is advisable in this space.Q: How do you summarize the year (2023) passing by?Year 2023 started with the fear of a global recession and expectations of larger interest rate hikes by global as well as domestic central banks which reflected in subdued equity market returns in first quarter of the calendar year. However, equity indices swiftly rebounded April’23 onwards on the back of rate hike pause by RBI, strong FPI flows and a sharp drop in brent crude prices. A more impressive market rally was witnessed in H2CY24 (November 2023 onwards) when GDP growth no. of 7.6 percent surprised the street positively and US Fed indicated start of a rate cut cycle in 2024.These factors further encouraged the domestic and foreign investors both to pour additional money in Indian equities as India offered much higher expected growth in coming quarters compared to its peer countries. Overall, 2023 will be remembered for a dynamic midcap and small cap rally, bustling Indian primary market and strong FPI flows apart from achieving an extraordinary accomplishment of crossing $4 trillion market cap by country’s equity markets.Q: What are the factors to look at in 2024, which can support and dent market?Calendar year 2024 is expected to provide answers to many much-awaited questions such as: future of domestic and global inflation trajectory and hence stance of central banks, timing, and pace of interest rate reductions in US and India, outcome of general elections in India and hence government’s policy stance impacting various sectors of the economy. In our view, these are few key factors which will occupy attention of investors.Apart from this, recovery of rural economy in India will be keenly monitored as this is one of the drivers of domestic economy which is yet to contribute towards growth in any substantial way. On the global front, US economy and extent of recession, if any, will be keenly watched as this would decide the fate of India’s export focused sectors such as IT, engineering goods and pharma.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Sokol oil is supplied to IOC by Sakhalin-1 LLC, a unit of Rosneft, sources said.Indian state refiners settle oil trade with Russia in United Arab Emirates dirhams after the government advised them against use of the Chinese yuan, though private refiners are still paying in yuan owing to a lack of alternatives.IOC's payments for Sokol oil have been hampered because Sakhalin-1 LLC has been unable to open an account with a bank in the UAE to accept dirham payments, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to the media.Representatives of IOC and Rosneft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.IOC was supposed to receive six Sokol cargoes from late November to December, shipping data showed. This included NS Century, which was placed under U.S. sanctions last month.These cargoes are now mostly floating around India and Sri Lanka while NS Century is heading towards Singapore, the data shows.""The supplier has an intent to deliver crude oil. Hopefully a solution will be found soon,"" one of the sources said.India has emerged as the biggest buyer of sea-borne Russian oil since the retreat by European customers after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.India's oil ministry has told a parliamentary panel that state oil companies face challenges in paying for Russian oil because not all Indian banks can process payments in U.S. dollars for Russian oil, according to a report tabled in parliament last week.Indian refiners buy Russian oil on a delivered basis because western sanctions pose challenges in arranging ships, insurance and payments. Last year India set up a mechanism to pay in rupees for imports including crude.However, suppliers have expressed concern about the repatriation of funds and high costs associated with conversion of funds along with exchange fluctuation risks, the ministry told the parliamentary panel.It added that suppliers had asked IOC to bear additional transactional costs for accepting payments in rupees.The ministry also told the panel that Indian refiners are abiding by the $60 per barrel price cap imposed by G7 nations on oil at Russian ports.Below is a table of Sokol cargoes affected by payment problems.Vessel Initial planned Destination Currentarrival date locationKrymsk Dec. 5 Paradip Bay of BengalNellis Dec. 21 Paradip Bay of BengalLiteyny Dec. 22 Paradip Bay of BengalProspectNS Commander Dec. 16 Vadinar off ColomboSakhalin Island Dec. 20 Vadinar anchored offColomboNS Century Nov. 25 Vadinar heading toSingaporeSource: LSEG Check Free Credit Score on Moneycontrol: Easily track your loans, get insights, and enjoy a ₹100 cashback on your first check!

U.S. WTI crude futures were down 22 cents, or 0.29%, at $75.35 a barrel.Prices on Tuesday climbed more than 2% to their highest this month, continuing last week's upward momentum which saw prices rise more than 3%, partly on hopes of U.S. interest rate cuts that could boost economic growth and fuel demand.However, the prospect of a prolonged Israeli military campaign in Gaza and the spillover of the conflict to attacks on ships in the Red Sea remain major drivers of market sentiment.On Tuesday, Israel's Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi on Tuesday told reporters that the Gaza war would go on ""for many months"", while Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi militia claimed responsibility for a missile attack on a container ship in the Red Sea.Despite the attack, major shipping firms such as Maersk and France's CMA CGM were resuming passage through the Red Sea following the deployment of a multinational task force to the region.Germany's Hapag-Lloyd is expected decide about resuming shipments on Wednesday.Markets continue to be supported by speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin to lower interest rates in 2024, after data showed on Friday that by some key measures - such as the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - inflation is now at or below the central bank's 2% goal.Lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs, which can stimulate economic growth and greater oil demand.U.S. crude stocks were expected to have fallen by 2.6 million barrels last week, while distillate and gasoline inventories likely rose, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.Inventory reports from the American Petroleum Institute industry group and the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, are expected on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, a day later than normal for both reports due to the Christmas holiday.

Delhi Police and the security team are still investigating the situation.""The recommendations of the Israeli National Security Council (NSC) on Tuesday, which come amid concerns of a ""recurrence of events"", apply especially to New Delhi.Israeli nationals have been warned to try to avoid going to crowded places (malls and markets) and places identified as serving Westerners/Jews and Israelis.They have also been urged to be on heightened alert in public places (including restaurants, hotels, pubs, etc).The recommendations also suggest avoiding openly displaying Israeli symbols, refraining from attending unsecured large-scale events, and avoiding publicising itineraries on social media as well as photographs and details of visits in real-time.The Israeli Foreign Ministry, in a press statement earlier on Tuesday, said that there were no casualties in the explosion.""The incident is under investigation by the local authorities in full cooperation with the Israeli security forces"", the ministry said.Soon after the explosion, which took place in a green belt area outside the Central Hindi Training Institute located near the embassy, teams of Delhi Police's Special Cell, bomb disposal squad and fire department rushed to the spot. An almost three-hour-long search operation was carried out in the area.A National Investigation Agency (NIA) team also examined the site, a senior police officer in New Delhi said.After the incident, security was further beefed up around the embassy and other Israeli establishments, according to officials.Earlier this month, the NSC warned Israelis to reconsider all their travel abroad and called on those who do need to travel overseas to avoid outward displays of their Jewish and Israeli identities amid rising antisemitism around the world amidst the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas militant group in Gaza. In the past, too, the Israeli embassy and its staff have come under attack in New Delhi.There was an explosion outside the Israeli embassy in 2021 in which cars were damaged, but no casualties were reported.In February 2012, the wife of an Israeli security staff at the embassy was injured in an attack on her car in New Delhi.Security has been high around the Israel embassy in New Delhi since the war between Israel and Hamas began earlier this year, security officials said.

The ITC's order does not affect the lower-priced Apple Watch SE, which does not have pulse-oximetry capabilities and remains on sale at Apple.The ITC decision says it applies only to Apple Watches with the light-based pulse oximetry capability in question, but does not specify which models with that technology are affected. Apple first introduced pulse oximetry in its Series 6 watches, and Masimo has argued that all Apple Watches with the technology infringe its patents.Apple said it would also stop replacing out-of-warranty watches going back to Series 6 based on the ban.The ban specifically applies to Apple and its ""affiliated companies, parents, subsidiaries, or other related business entities,"" and may not affect other retailers selling Apple Watches.Series 9 Apple Watches were still available from sellers including Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart as of Dec. 26.What are the accusations against Apple?Masimo, which released a watch last year that also reads blood-oxygen levels and tracks other health indicators, accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its technology after discussing a potential collaboration. A jury trial on Masimo's allegations in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May and has not yet been rescheduled.Apple has called Irvine, California-based Masimo's legal actions a scheme to clear a path for its competing smartwatch, and has countersued Masimo for patent infringement in Delaware federal court.What are Apple's options now?Apple is expected to appeal the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. The ITC on Dec. 20 rejected Apple's bid to pause the ban during an appeal.Apple is also reportedly working on software changes to enable its watches to operate without infringing Masimo's patents. It could resume importing and selling the watches if U.S. Customs and Border Protection approves the workaround.Masimo has said that its patents cover hardware, and that a software fix would not work.Masimo CEO Joe Kiani has also indicated that he is willing to settle the dispute.

The Sensex recorded a gain of 230 points, closing at 71,337, while the Nifty surged by 92 points, reaching 21,441. Nifty Bank saw an increase of 233 points, closing at 47,725, and the Midcap index registered a substantial gain of 293 points, closing at 45,388.Technically, the Nifty encountered profit-taking while approaching the 21,500 levels. Although it demonstrated a strong recovery from the 21,000 level, it is crucial for the bullish momentum to resume that the 21,500–21,600 supply zone is breached. Currently, the market landscape is defined by the 20,900–21,600 range.In the case of Bank nifty, the resistance is observed in the 48,000–48,200 zone, with potential strength building above it in the 48,500–48,800 range. On the downside, a robust demand zone lies within the 47,000–46,800 range.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:JB Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,618 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,490 | Target: Rs 1,814 | Return: 12 percentThe stock has recently broken out of a triangle formation with significant volume support, establishing a solid base at approximately Rs 1,400. The stock's overall structure appears promising, as it is trading above key moving averages.The MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicates ongoing strength, and the RSI (relative strength index) momentum indicator is also in positive territory.Looking ahead, the Rs 1,700 levels serve as a crucial psychological barrier; a breach beyond this point could potentially lead to a near-term target of Rs 1,800 or higher. On the downside, initial support is anticipated around Rs 1,490.India Pesticides: Buy | LTP: Rs 370 | Stop-Loss: Rs 338 | Target: Rs 424 | Return: 14 percentThe counter has broken above a horizontal resistance level that had been in place for several days. The breakout was accompanied by strong volume, which adds confirmation to the validity of the breakout. The counter has surpassed its IPO listing high of Rs 368. The overall structure of the counter is very lucrative, as it is trading above all its important moving averages.On the upside, rs 400 is an immediate resistance area; above this, we can expect a run-up towards Rs 420+ levels in the near term. On the downside, Rs 338 is major support in any correction.Kalyan Jewellers India: Buy | LTP: Rs 343.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 310 | Target: Rs 390 | Return: 14 percentThe counter is in an awesome uptrend with a breakout of a triangle formation with strong volume. The overall structure of the counter is very lucrative, as it is trading above all of its important moving averages.On the higher time frame, there is a breakout of a bullish flag formation, which suggests much more potential upside in this counter. It has retested its previous breakout level of Rs 300 after hitting a fresh all-time high.The momentum indicator RSI is positively poised, whereas MACD is witnessing a centerline crossover on the upside.On the higher side, Rs 360 is acting as an important psychological level; above this, we can expect the level of Rs 390+ in the near-short term, while on the lower side, Rs 310 will act as a major support during any correction.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

All three are on track for monthly, quarterly and annual gains.Interest rate sensitive megacap stocks and chip shares led the upward momentum.On Friday, the three indexes notched their eighth straight weekly gains - their longest weekly winning streaks in years - as economic data indicated inflation is easing down closer to the Fed's average annual 2% target.""The momentum stays towards the upside,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, noting however that a strong rally was unlikely in light trading.""We had a good inflation number on Friday.

The company cut off sales right before the Christmas holiday and in a motion filed Tuesday, Apple said it would suffer irreparable harm if previous court orders remain for the two weeks that it said the U.S.International Trade Commission will take to respond to its appeal. The company cut off sales right before the Christmas holiday and in a motion filed Tuesday, Apple said it would suffer irreparable harm if previous court orders remain for the two weeks that it said the U.S. International Trade Commission will take to respond to its appeal.Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates Apple’s holiday-season sales would be reduced by between $300 million and $400 million. On Oct. 26, the ITC determined that Apple infringed on two patents owned by Masimo Corp. and Cercacor Laboratories, both U.S. companies. After a 60-day review, the ITC’s decision became final Tuesday, but the company had already pulled the watches from store shelves and removed them from its online sales lineup.On Tuesday, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai let the ITC decision stand. After careful consultations, Ambassador Tai decided not to reverse the ITC’s determination, the office of the U.S. Trade representative said, meaning that the ITC decision officially went into effect Tuesday. The Cupertino, California tech giant stopped online sales of its Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 internet-connected watch Thursday in the U.S. after ITC rejected Apple’s bid to get around a late October order blocking the company from using some of the technology underlying the blood oxygen measurement feature on the watches. Previously purchased Apple Watches equipped with blood oxygen measurement aren’t affected by the ITC order.Apple contends that the ITC’s decision is based on multiple factual errors and that Masimo does not sell a competing product in the U.S. in meaningful quantities and would not suffer harm if the order is stayed. Shares of Apple Inc. are down slightly on a day when the tech sector is one of the strongest in Tuesday trading.

While Bengaluru-based Prestige is widening to Mumbai, Mumbai-based Godrej Properties is reaching out to Delhi-NCR. Many listed developers are selling out luxury projects in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. But, who exactly are buying these flats? Ask any fund manager and the reply is, ""startup employees with ESOPs and midcap company promoters who have turned millionaires overnight"".Castrol (Rs 182.55, +12.30%)The stock gained on heavy volumes. Yesterday's trading volume was over 8 times the 20-day average volumes.Bull case: A strong brand with good dividend play. The company has developed a range of fluids for EVs and is getting future ready. Valuations are not demanding.Bear case: Lubricants is a crowded market. OMCs hold a major chunk of the market. Catrol's sales and profit growth has been in mid-single digits over the past few years. FII and DII holding has not moved, while the LIC stake overhang stays on.Kansai Nerolac (Rs 324.70, +0.70%)The stock will be in focus as it has sold a land parcel for Rs 726 crore. The FY23 net profit was about Rs 820 crore. So all eyes on other income thisquarter.Bull case: New products have improved the share of premium products in the decorative segment. Automotive paints segment continues to see traction.Bear case: Slower sales growth than Asian Paints and Berger. Grasim's impending entry could hurt market share. DII holding has fallen over the last few quarters.Bharat Electronics (Rs 182.50, +4.45%)Shares reacted positively to order wins worth Rs 678 crore, including a contract for Rs 445 crore from the UP government for the UP Dial 112 project.Bull case: Orderbook is healthy. The company is a prime beneficiary of the Make-in-India defence theme. Diversifying revenue to non-defence streams such as the UP project is a positive move.Bear case: Any delay in order execution and high raw material prices can impact margins. Dependency on imports continues to be a challenge.Adani Wilmar (Rs 363, -0.63%)Promoters of Adani Wilmar have conveyed their intention to sell the equity shares to comply with minimum public shareholding norms.Bull case: Market leader in branded edible oils segment.

Digitisation of mine records is also on the cards.In an interview to PTI, Coal Secretary Amrit Lal Meena said the government has already notified two policies with respect to coal gasification and plans to provide financial support as well as tax incentives for such projects.The ministry of coal has set a target to gasify 100 Million Tonnes (MT) of coal by FY 2030 in line with its energy transition plans.""Now, we are coming out with a policy for certain financial support and tax incentives (for coal gasification projects). This is under consideration... and we will ensure that coal gasification will see positive acceleration,"" Meena said.He also emphasised that the government is working to create an enabling environment to promote coal gasification.Coal gasification is expected to reduce imports by 2030 as well as reduce carbon emissions and foster sustainable practices.In order to address environmental concerns in the coal gasification process, the government has mandated grant of green clearance wherein the project proponent has to conduct environment impact assessment studies and prepare an environment management plan.The plan will be duly examined by an expert committee before taking up any activities related to establishment of a coal gasification plant.The Centre has also formulated a policy wherein, a provision has been made for 50 per cent rebate in revenue share for all future commercial coal block auctions for the fossil fuel used for gasification.This will be subject to the condition that the quantity used for gasification is at least 10 per cent of the total production.Separate auction window under the non-regulated sector has also been put in place for making coal available for new coal gasification plants.According to the secretary, out of the total 91 commercial blocks and 55 captive mines, 51 mines are currently operational. These blocks produced 116 MT of coal in the last financial year and the target is 162 MT for the current fiscal ending March 2024.The government is aiming to scale up coal production from underground mines to 100 MT by 2030 by deploying mass production technology.India's coal sector is the second largest in the world with production rising 14.8 per cent to 893 MT in 2022-2023 financial year. The country accounts for more than 10 per cent of the global coal production and is second after China.In order to achieve self-reliance in coal production and reduce imports, the government is working towards increasing the domestic coal production output to over 1 billion tonnes in 2023-2024 and further increase it to 1.5 billion tonnes by 2029-2030.For now, coal, which powers thermal power plants, is key for meeting the country's rising electricity demand.Regular reviews by the coal ministry to expedite the development of coal blocks and single window clearance portal for the sector, among other factors, have helped in increasing the production of the dry fuel.A Project Monitoring Unit has also been set up for hand-holding coal block allottees for obtaining various clearances for early operationalisation of coal mines.Ravi Pokharna, Executive Director of policy think tank Pahle India Foundation (PIF) said India is one of the fastest growing economies and it continues to be one of the key players driving global coal demand owing to its increasing energy needs.""This year also saw India reinforcing its commitments of achieving a 50 per cent power demand by non-fossil fuels by 2030... during COP 28, the Indian government did well to assert its right to continue using coal to fuel its growth, and demand developed economies to contribute to the transition in emerging economies,"" he said.Indian Federation of Green Energy Director General Sanjay Ganjoo said that based on the present use of biomass co-firing of 5-10 per cent, some 50-100 MT of coal will be replaced by biomass by 2030.""It is equivalent to reducing 90 to 180 million of CO2 emissions,"" he said.

After a long pause in US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) inspections on account of the pandemic, inspections were back in full swing in 2023.India's pharmaceutical exports saw a 37 percent (in terms of export value) rise from January to November, marking a positive trend. In terms of volume, the quantity was up 26 percent to over 63,000 tonnes in October 2023. India remained the largest generic drugs supplier to the US, contributing to almost 40 percent of the US market.Many top Indian companies reported record high sales in the US this year. For Q2 FY 24 results, Cipla achieved record-breaking quarterly sales of $229 million. In the same period, Lupin’s US sales crossed $200 million for the first time in nearly the last two years, while Sun Pharma reported US formulation sales of $430 million.Issues of substandard drugs continueIn late 2022, the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued an alert over child fatalities and adverse reactions to cough syrups in multiple countries, tracing some back to products originating in India. Throughout 2023, such incidents persisted, involving QP Pharma Chem's tainted syrups in the Marshall Islands and Micronesia, SyneCare in Nigeria, and the WHO flagging Fourrts Labs' cold Out in Iraq. Indiana Ophthalmics and Global Pharma faced serious allegations, including instances of eye damage in Sri Lanka and contamination in the US, linked to vision loss and a fatality.The common factor in the cases involving cough syrups was the presence of dangerous levels of toxic substances, particularly diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol. Manufacturers often denied responsibility, claiming these ingredients were not used, or attributing the issues to improper product administration. In the case of the eye drops, the issues were caused by contamination.Also read: Drug regulator issues warning against cold medication for children under 4 yrsIn response, Indian regulators took significant actions, inspecting 76 companies and revoking licenses of 18 of them producing spurious drugs. The government mandated rigorous testing of cough syrups before export, with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) temporarily pausing testing for other products. Regulators and industry associations, including the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) and the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA), initiated training and education for Indian entities.US FDA inspections surge after the Covid slowdownAfter a long pause in US FDA inspection during the pandemic, inspections were back in full swing in 2023. Among the 189 inspections, 20 plants received the highest level of action, Official Action Indicated (OAI), up from 12 in 2022 and 5 in 2021. Number of US FDA inspections in Indian manufacturing facilities have increased post CovidAs Indian companies are focusing more on specialty drugs, the frequency of inspections is expected to increase. “Inspections are a necessary part of the lifecycle of these companies. As time passes the standards required by the regulator will also increase. It is natural,” noted Manoj Garg, Director of Investments, WhiteOak Capital.US FDA Commissioner Robert M Califf had said in an interaction with CNBC TV 18 during his India visit in September, that the regulator will conduct more unannounced inspections.A US Congressional committee had said that US FDA inspections in China and India are “inadequate”. It said that plants in the countries show a “pattern of repeatedly violating FDA safety regulations” and indulged in destroying or falsifying data, and using non-sterile manufacturing processes. Number of serious regulatory actions against Indian pharma plants have increased in 2023“If you look at pharma it is at that inflection point. We can draw a lot of parallels between the Indian pharmaceutical industry today and the IT industry in 2000,” said Gauri Chaudhari, author of `The Perfect Pill: 10 Steps to Build a Strong Healthcare Brand’. “There must be constant training and education on quality and strict inspections for the implementation of the quality standards to help pharma take a leap like what IT took in the early 2000s,” she added.Also read: US FDA to step up unannounced inspections on Indian pharma plants Check Free Credit Score on Moneycontrol: Easily track your loans, get insights, and enjoy a ₹100 cashback on your first check!

Stocks related to real estate, industrials and capital goods are among those leading the gains, while Adani Group companies — the heavy hitters of 2022 — are mostly finishing with losses despite a rebound in recent months.As the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index heads for an eighth year of gains with returns of 17% in 2023, expectations that the party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will win elections in 2024 are raising hopes this bull run may continue.Global funds have bought more than $20 billion of local shares in 2023, after taking out $17 billion last year, signaling investors’ preference for India as China grapples with an economic slowdown.Here’s a look at some of the significant stock moves of 2023:Real EstateA measure of real estate stocks rallied to its highest level since 2008, outpacing all other sector indexes managed by the BSE Ltd. A pause in interest-rate hikes, demand for luxury housing and investments by Indians living abroad boosted developers. Prestige Estates Projects Ltd. surged about 140%, while DLF Ltd. almost doubled.“A combination of a strong pent-up demand for housing, above average affordability and 12-year low unsold inventory should drive a multi-year virtuous housing cycle,” according to a Jefferies note this month.InfrastructureEngineering behemoth Larsen & Toubro Ltd. and UltraTech Cement Ltd. ranked among the top performers on the benchmark gauge, underscoring the focus on building infrastructure in the world’s most-populous nation.“Cement is a good way to play real estate and infrastructure sectors in India and it can do well in 2024,” said Arun Malhotra, a fund manager with CapGrow Capital Advisors LLP. “We have seen real estate activity remaining firm and companies getting strong bookings for projects.”State-owned firms had their best year since 2009 as the government ramped up spending. While NTPC Ltd. and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd. led the gains on the key 30-member index, lenders of state projects, including REC Ltd. and Power Finance Corp., surged more than 200% each.Small- and Mid-CapsThe stellar performance of small cap stocks saw investors flocking to benefit from the gains, with many asset managers opening new funds to capitalize on the demand.Stocks including AurionPro Solutions Ltd. and Titagarh Rail Systems Ltd. climbed 546% and 365%, respectively. Among notable mid-cap winners are Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., Trent Ltd. and Polycab India Ltd.For next year, Kotak Securities prefers mega-caps due to their valuations and “greater immunity in the event of any negative developments in the next few months,” the brokerage said in a note dated Dec. 18.Adani, VedantaFour companies of the Adani Group are among the worst 10 performers on the S&P BSE 200 Index this year, with flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. down more than 25%. The conglomerate drew global attention after a scathing report from shortseller Hindenburg Research in January triggered a stock rout.Although some of its businesses with lucrative assets such as Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd. and Adani Power Ltd. have climbed beyond their pre-report levels, most of group’s stocks are yet to fully recover the losses.Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd. lost 15% this year, with investors wary of the mining giant’s heavy debt load.Tech, EVNew-age technology companies staged a comeback, with Zomato Ltd. more than doubling in value on growth in online food orders.

Their one-year forward target prices have been revised to Rs 11,500, Rs 2,900, and Rs 1,250, respectively, indicating potential upsides of 15 percent, 32 percent, and 28 percent. It retained the 'buy' tag on Shree Cements but raised the target price to Rs 33,400 from Rs 27,800.Shares of Ultratech Cement jumped to a fresh 52-week high of Rs 10,379.70 and gained nearly 3 percent, while Dalmia Bharat rose nearly 4 percent and Ramco Cement 3 percent. Shree Cement erased its morning gains and traded marginally lower around mid-day.India's cement industry showed robust volume growth of 17 percent year-on-year in the first half of FY24. The momentum is expected to persist in the second half, anticipating an 11 percent increase in sales volumes from the first half and a 13 percent year-on-year surge, Nomura said. It has revised its industry volume growth estimate to 12 percent for FY24, up from 8 percent earlier.""For FY25, cement demand, in our view, is likely to moderate as infrastructure project launches typically slow down in the country in a general election year. However, the demand should remain higher than the past 10-year CAGR of 4 percent, largely due to the central government’s continued thrust on infrastructure, stable demand from rural and affordable housing and a pickup in urban housing. We expect a 5 percent CAGR in cement demand over FY24-26, but weak rural demand poses a downside risk,"" Nomura said in its note.Nomura highlighted strong volume growth and reduced fuel costs in FY24. Pet coke and thermal coal prices for FY24 dropped 35 percent and 45 percent year-to-date. Despite recent increases, spot prices remain significantly lower than the FY23 highs. Cement spreads have increased by Rs 300 per tonne in 3QFY24, based on a 90-day lagged fuel cost. Nomura expects an average unitary EBITDA improvement of Rs 200-250 per tonne in 3QFY24.Even if fuel costs rise, the full impact will be seen from 2QFY25F. Nomura predicts an average unitary EBITDA expansion of Rs 150-200 per tonne in FY25 due to robust volume momentum, improved pricing discipline, and relatively lower costs.Prakash Diwan notes that larger cement players (Ultratech Cement, ACC, Ambuja, and Dalmia Bharat) are gaining pricing power due to reduced raw material costs like coking coal and transportation. Favourable margins have been sustained due to lower crude oil prices over the past six months, except for recent disruptions in the Red Sea.Reports, like one from Nomura, have boosted enthusiasm in the sector, causing a surge in related cement stocks. With the housing sector contributing to 42 percent of India's cement production and growing infrastructure projects, existing capacities are expected to be better utilised, signaling positive prospects for the industry, he added.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Meanwhile, sharp fall in rupee was prevented due to decline in crude oil prices and as dollar hovered near 5-month low after PCE price index data showed annual US inflation slowed further below 3% in November. Rupee is likely to appreciate today amid soft dollar and decline in US treasury yields. Yields nosedive as recent inflation data bolstered expectations that US Federal Reserve will start cutting rates next year as soon as March.

After a long pause in US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) inspections on account of the pandemic, inspections were back in full swing in 2023.India's pharmaceutical exports saw a 37 percent (in terms of export value) rise from January to November, marking a positive trend. In terms of volume, the quantity was up 26 percent to over 63,000 tonnes in October 2023. India remained the largest generic drugs supplier to the US, contributing to almost 40 percent of the US market.Many top Indian companies reported record high sales in the US this year. For Q2 FY 24 results, Cipla achieved record-breaking quarterly sales of $229 million. In the same period, Lupin’s US sales crossed $200 million for the first time in nearly the last two years, while Sun Pharma reported US formulation sales of $430 million.Issues of substandard drugs continueIn late 2022, the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued an alert over child fatalities and adverse reactions to cough syrups in multiple countries, tracing some back to products originating in India. Throughout 2023, such incidents persisted, involving QP Pharma Chem's tainted syrups in the Marshall Islands and Micronesia, SyneCare in Nigeria, and the WHO flagging Fourrts Labs' cold Out in Iraq. Indiana Ophthalmics and Global Pharma faced serious allegations, including instances of eye damage in Sri Lanka and contamination in the US, linked to vision loss and a fatality.The common factor in the cases involving cough syrups was the presence of dangerous levels of toxic substances, particularly diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol. Manufacturers often denied responsibility, claiming these ingredients were not used, or attributing the issues to improper product administration. In the case of the eye drops, the issues were caused by contamination.Also read: Drug regulator issues warning against cold medication for children under 4 yrsIn response, Indian regulators took significant actions, inspecting 76 companies and revoking licenses of 18 of them producing spurious drugs. The government mandated rigorous testing of cough syrups before export, with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) temporarily pausing testing for other products. Regulators and industry associations, including the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) and the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA), initiated training and education for Indian entities.US FDA inspections surge after the Covid slowdownAfter a long pause in US FDA inspection during the pandemic, inspections were back in full swing in 2023. Among the 189 inspections, 20 plants received the highest level of action, Official Action Indicated (OAI), up from 12 in 2022 and 5 in 2021. Number of US FDA inspections in Indian manufacturing facilities have increased post CovidAs Indian companies are focusing more on specialty drugs, the frequency of inspections is expected to increase. “Inspections are a necessary part of the lifecycle of these companies. As time passes the standards required by the regulator will also increase. It is natural,” noted Manoj Garg, Director of Investments, WhiteOak Capital.US FDA Commissioner Robert M Califf had said in an interaction with CNBC TV 18 during his India visit in September, that the regulator will conduct more unannounced inspections.A US Congressional committee had said that US FDA inspections in China and India are “inadequate”. It said that plants in the countries show a “pattern of repeatedly violating FDA safety regulations” and indulged in destroying or falsifying data, and using non-sterile manufacturing processes. Number of serious regulatory actions against Indian pharma plants have increased in 2023“If you look at pharma it is at that inflection point. We can draw a lot of parallels between the Indian pharmaceutical industry today and the IT industry in 2000,” said Gauri Chaudhari, author of `The Perfect Pill: 10 Steps to Build a Strong Healthcare Brand’. “There must be constant training and education on quality and strict inspections for the implementation of the quality standards to help pharma take a leap like what IT took in the early 2000s,” she added.Also read: US FDA to step up unannounced inspections on Indian pharma plants Check Free Credit Score on Moneycontrol: Easily track your loans, get insights, and enjoy a ₹100 cashback on your first check!

With a ban on the export of de-oiled rice bran, the Association has projected exports of rapeseed meal and soymeal at 2.5 mln and 1.5 mln tn, respectively, in the current financial year. India's total oilmeal exports during Apr-Nov have increased by around 21% year-onyear to 2.8 mln tn, Jhunjhunwala said in the release. Demand for Indian soymeal in the international market was buoyant due to price competitiveness and shortage of supply by Argentina, he added. Also, rapeseed meal exports during Apr-Nov are at 1.6 mln tn and are likely to cross the record 2.3 mln tn exported last year, it said. The exports of castor meal are on track at 254,120 tn in Apr-Nov, higher than last year's exports of 235,200 tn during the year-ago period. Meanwhile, imports of refined, bleached, and deodorised palmolein are at 171,000 tn, which is more than twice that of the previous month, according to the release. Imports rose due to the low-duty difference of only 8.25% between crude and refined oils. ""This is to the detriment of our (India's) processing industry and of benefit to the exporting countries viz Indonesia and Malaysia,"" it said. The Association has recommended the government to increase the import duty on refined oil by at least 15% higher than that on crude cooking oil to enable the performance of domestic industry. As of Friday, the sowing area under oilseeds had reached 10.2 mln ha, largely unchanged from last year, according to data from the agriculture ministry. Rapeseed mustard leads the pack and covers a sowing area of 9.5 mln ha, against 9.3 mln ha a year ago. Though the sowing area under groundnut, sunflower, safflower, and seasamum currently shows a slight decline, rabi oilseed indicates a promising harvest as agriculture and climatic conditions are expected to be close to normal.For all commodities report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

The Sensex recorded a gain of 230 points, closing at 71,337, while the Nifty surged by 92 points, reaching 21,441. Nifty Bank saw an increase of 233 points, closing at 47,725, and the Midcap index registered a substantial gain of 293 points, closing at 45,388.Technically, the Nifty encountered profit-taking while approaching the 21,500 levels. Although it demonstrated a strong recovery from the 21,000 level, it is crucial for the bullish momentum to resume that the 21,500–21,600 supply zone is breached. Currently, the market landscape is defined by the 20,900–21,600 range.In the case of Bank nifty, the resistance is observed in the 48,000–48,200 zone, with potential strength building above it in the 48,500–48,800 range. On the downside, a robust demand zone lies within the 47,000–46,800 range.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:JB Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,618 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,490 | Target: Rs 1,814 | Return: 12 percentThe stock has recently broken out of a triangle formation with significant volume support, establishing a solid base at approximately Rs 1,400. The stock's overall structure appears promising, as it is trading above key moving averages.The MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicates ongoing strength, and the RSI (relative strength index) momentum indicator is also in positive territory.Looking ahead, the Rs 1,700 levels serve as a crucial psychological barrier; a breach beyond this point could potentially lead to a near-term target of Rs 1,800 or higher. On the downside, initial support is anticipated around Rs 1,490.India Pesticides: Buy | LTP: Rs 370 | Stop-Loss: Rs 338 | Target: Rs 424 | Return: 14 percentThe counter has broken above a horizontal resistance level that had been in place for several days. The breakout was accompanied by strong volume, which adds confirmation to the validity of the breakout. The counter has surpassed its IPO listing high of Rs 368. The overall structure of the counter is very lucrative, as it is trading above all its important moving averages.On the upside, rs 400 is an immediate resistance area; above this, we can expect a run-up towards Rs 420+ levels in the near term. On the downside, Rs 338 is major support in any correction.Kalyan Jewellers India: Buy | LTP: Rs 343.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 310 | Target: Rs 390 | Return: 14 percentThe counter is in an awesome uptrend with a breakout of a triangle formation with strong volume. The overall structure of the counter is very lucrative, as it is trading above all of its important moving averages.On the higher time frame, there is a breakout of a bullish flag formation, which suggests much more potential upside in this counter. It has retested its previous breakout level of Rs 300 after hitting a fresh all-time high.The momentum indicator RSI is positively poised, whereas MACD is witnessing a centerline crossover on the upside.On the higher side, Rs 360 is acting as an important psychological level; above this, we can expect the level of Rs 390+ in the near-short term, while on the lower side, Rs 310 will act as a major support during any correction.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
